\abstract{
%
We study the sensitivity of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) programme at
Fermilab to MeV sterile neutrino decay-in-flight in both a minimal extension
and more generic beyond the Standard Model scenarios. We provide estimates for
the bounds that first \muboone\ and subsequently the full SBN complex can be
expected to place on the parameter spaces of these models. We show that the
facility can in many cases extend existing bounds on $\ster \rightarrow
\nu_\alpha e^+ e^-$ and $\ster \rightarrow l^- \pi^+$ whilst, due to the strong
particle identification capabilities of liquid-Argon technology, also place
bounds on as yet unconstrained channels $\ster \rightarrow \gamma \nu_\alpha$
and $\ster \rightarrow \nu_\alpha \pi^0$, which may be enhanced in a
non-minimal model.
%
We then compare the signals of decays in flight to other models with sterile
neutrinos and show that significant differences exist between the spectra of a
decay in flight signal and alternative models motivated by the MiniBooNE
excess.
%
Finally, we show that the particular design of SBN, with three detectors at
different baselines, in principle allows for observable structure in the timing
distributions of events and we assess the regions of parameter space for which
such a measurement could be expected.

\section{Introduction}

The neutrino sector of the Standard Model (SM) is known to be incomplete. The
observation of oscillatory behaviour between neutrino flavour states suggests a
set of mass matrices with off-diagonal terms in the flavour basis. There are
many ways that have been suggested in the literature to explain neutrino masses
from a theoretical perspective, ranging from the popular see-saw scenarios
\cite{Minkowski:1977sc, GellMann:1980vs, Mohapatra:1979ia} to radiative mass
generation \cite{XXX} or even more involved constructions \cite{XXX}. It will
ultimately be the role of phenomenology to find ways to distinguish between
candidate models, and see what can be learnt from the completion of the
neutrino sector about the structure of BSM physics.
%
However, not all models of neutrino masses lend themselves to experimental
searches. For example, the canonical Type-I see-saw \cite{Minkowski:1977sc,
GellMann:1980vs, Mohapatra:1979ia} suggests the existence of new particles with
masses around $10^{12}$--$10^{15}$ GeV, well out of reach of modern
experimental techniques.  One observable feature of some models is the presence
of novel fermionic singlets of the SM gauge group, which we shall refer to as
sterile neutrinos.  These will generically mix with the `active' neutrinos of
the SM and could alter neutrino phenomenology at observable scales. 
%
A well known example of such an effect is the short-baseline disappearance
signature associated with a sterile neutrino with a mass around the eV scale
(see \eg\ \refref{Gariazzo:2015rra} for a recent review). Such a state would
produce oscillatory effects over short distances and has been invoked to solve
the anomalies found at some short-baseline oscillation experiments.  Explaining
all anomalies in an economical fashion appears challenging in these models
\cite{Kopp:2013vaa}, but more data would be needed before a decision can be
made as to their role in the neutrino sector.

In this article, we study a complementary paradigm to the oscillatory sterile
neutrino models where sterile neutrinos exist, are produced in neutrino beams
via meson decay, but have masses sufficiently large to prevent oscillatory
effects with the active neutrinos through loss of coherence (see \eg\
\refref{Akhmedov:2009rb}).  Due to the presence of mixing effects, these
particles are not generically expected to be stable and their subsequent decays
have been enumerated \cite{Atre:2009rg} and searched for in many previous
experiments.
%
Our focus will be on estimating the potential sensitivity of the Fermilab SBN
programme \cite{Antonello:2015lea} for the search for sterile neutrinos of this
type. 
%
This experimental facility comprises of three separate detectors placed in the
Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at different (short) baseline distances: SBND
(previously known as LAr1-ND) at 110~m from the target, \muboone\ at 470~m and
ICARUS at 600~m.  All three detectors employ Liquid Argon (LAr) technology
giving unprecedented reconstruction and particle identification capabilities
allowing for significantly lower backgrounds than predecessor technologies. We
will focus in particular on \muboone\ as it the experiment has already began
to collect data and will be first of the SBN detectors to be able to perform
such a search.
%
The SBN facility has a number of interesting features relevant to the search
for sterile neutrino decay:

\begin{enumerate}

\item The reconstruction, timing resolution and particle ID capabilities of LAr
technology means the SBN program provides an ideal scenario to study the decay
in flight of sterile neutrinos, a job which has traditionally been left for
low-mass detectors with corresponding low beam-related backgrounds. 
%
We will discuss how a very high level of background suppression can be obtained
through a simple cut-based analysis motivated by the kinematic properties of a
beam-based decay-in-flight signal. 

\item The three detectors allow for timing-based effects between 
the three detectors if the excess comes from a sterile neutrino decay 
model. As we will discuss in \refsec{sec:timing}, this means that a decaying 
sterile neutrino would have a very distinctive pattern of excess events at
SBN, unobservable to a facility with a single detector.

\item The excellent particle identification will allow for the investigation of
channels for which there are no published searches, only inferred bounds based
on minimal theoretical models. We will discuss extended models of sterile decay
where the minimal model correlations between decay channels do not hold. This
means that there are no published bounds on some channels, and a decay rate in
a traditionally excluded region could be observed at the SBN complex. In the
absence of signal, the facility could of course place the first bounds on these
signatures of new physics.

\end{enumerate}

factor of $38.5$.}

\end{table}

Decaying heavy sterile neutrinos have been searched for at many experiments
since the early 1970s \cite{}. In the mass range of interest for SBN, the
strongest bounds on sterile which mix with electron and muon neutrinos come
from PS-191 \cite{Bernardi:1985ny}, which ran at CERN from 1983 to 1985. 
%
PS-191 was located 128m downstream of the target and $2.3^\circ$ (40 mrads) off
axis, obtained $0.86 \times 10^{19}$ POT over the course of its run-time, and
had a total detector volume of $6\times3\times12 = 216 \text{m}^3$. We can
estimate the sensitivity of the three SBN detectors and how they will compare
to PS-191 by estimating the experiments' \emph{exposure}, defined here as POT
$\times$ Vol $\times$ $R^{-2}$. We compare the three facilities to PS-191 in
\reftab{tab:exposure}, which shows that all detectors of the SBN complex expect
a larger exposure, with SBND seeing the largest enhancement by a factor of
around $40$. Although the majority of the sensitivity of the full SBN data set
will come from SBND with its larger event rates, the data will be collected at
different times --- \muboone\ has already begun to take data and will be able
to search for such decays many years before SBND and ICARUS come online --- for
this reason, we will consider all detector sites in our analysis.

In addition to the larger exposure, there is also an enhancement of the
expected decay events at SBN due to its lower beam energy. The steriles at SBN
are produced by the 8 GeV BNB beam and have a softer spectrum than those
produced by the 19.2 GeV proton synchrotron beam used at PS-191. As we will
discuss in more detail in \refsec{Decays}, the probability of sterile neutrino
decay scales as $1/E_\nu$, and we would therefore expect the SBN facilities to
see more events than PS-191 for equivalent exposures.

Despite the advantage of scale at SBN, backgrounds could limit the improvement
in performance when compared to PS-191. PS-191 was purposefully built to search
for decays in flight of heavy fermions, and to minimize the background induced
by active neutrino scattering, the total mass of the detector was chosen to be
small (approximately $20$ ton)\marcom{PB}{I'm not sure I get this: do we mean
cosmics? Why wouldn't the backgrounds and signal scale in the same way?}. The
SBN detectors, whose primary goal is to study neutrino scattering, have
significantly larger masses ($112$, $66.6$ and $476$ tons respectively). We
therefore expect SBN to not only see a greater number of decay events than
PS-191, but to also see a greater background. 
%
To understand the sensitivity of SBN to heavy sterile decay, the background
rejection capabilities of LAr must be sufficiently well understood.  We will
discuss this in more detail in \refapp{sec:bg}.

\section{Sterile neutrino decay}

The most general renormalizable \lagrangian\ extending the SM to include a
single novel gauge-singlet fermion $\ster$ is given by
%
\begin{align}   \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_\text{SM} +
\overline{\ster}i\slashed{\partial}\ster+ \frac{\mu}{2}
\overline{\ster^\text{c}}\ster  + y_\alpha\overline{L}_\alpha\tilde{H} \ster +
y_\alpha^* \overline{\ster}\widetilde{H}^*L_\alpha\label{eq:minimallag}
\end{align}
%
where $y_\alpha$ denote Yukawa couplings and $\mu$ a Majorana mass term for
$\ster$. The extension to multiple new fermions involves promoting $y$ and
$\mu$ to matrices with indices for the new states, but will offer no real
phenomenological difference in the current work.\footnote{The minimal single
$\ster$ extension does not allow for the observed masses of the neutrinos, as
the mass matrix is rank 1. We assume that an appropriate extension has been
introduced to satisfy neutrino oscillation data while introducing no new
dynamics at the lower energy scales of interest.} Much work has been done
understanding the phenomenology of novel neutral states, which varies
significantly over their large parameter spaces. 
%
Lagrangians similar to this have been useed in the literature for a wide range
of purposes. If the new particle has a mass around $10^{15}$ GeV it could
provide a natural way to suppress the size of active neutrino masses through
the Type I or III see-saw mechanisms \cite{Minkowski:1977sc, GellMann:1980vs,
Mohapatra:1979ia}. A lighter neutral fermion, with a mass around the keV scale,
remains a promising dark matter candidate \cite{Adhikari:2016bei}. A synthesis
of these ideas is found in the so-called $\nu$MSM which simultaneously can
explain dark matter, neutrino masses and successful baryogenesis
\cite{Asaka:2005pn}. 
%
If the sterile gets lighter still, with masses at the eV scale or below, an
important observable effects might exist in neutrino oscillation experiments.
Indeed, such particles have been proposed to alleviate short-baseline
oscillation anomalies; although, no minimal solution seems to provide a
compelling universal improvement to the current data \cite{Kopp:2013vaa}. 

For steriles which are light enough to be produced in a neutrino beam,
typically with masses below the $D$-meson mass scale $m_{\ster} \lesssim
2$~GeV, there is a qualitative divide in the phenomenology somewhere between
keV and eV energies\footnote{The precise mass range depends on details of the
process under consideration.}. If the sterile neutrinos are massive enough for
their mass-splittings between the light neutrinos to be larger than the
wavepacket uncertainty associated with the production mechanism, they no longer
oscillate \cite{Akhmedov:2009rb}.  
%
Once oscillation is suppressed, neutral particles produced in the beam will
propagate towards the detector and may be observed by their subsequent decay
into SM particles. Experiments seeking to measure such decays are generally
known as beam dump experiments where proton collisions with a target produce
particles to be observed down-wind of the source \cite{CooperSarkar:1985nh,
Bergsma:1985is, Vaitaitis:1999wq, Bernardi:1985ny, Bernardi:1987ek,
Anelli:2015pba, Alekhin:2015byh}. It has been pointed out that the difference
between a beam dump and a conventional neutrino beam is more a matter of
philosophy, and we can expect many experiments to have some sensitivity to
novel heavy states \cite{Gorbunov:2007ak, Asaka:2012bb, Adams:2013qkq}. 
%
For the BNB, we can estimate the mass at which this decoupling occurs as
follows: the decay pipe for BNB is around $50$~m in length, which is
considerably shorter than the decay lengths of the mesons in the beam.
Therefore this length defines the wavepacket width at production.  The relevant
parameter is the decoherence parameter \cite{Akhmedov:2009rb, Hernandez:2011rs}
%
\[  \xi = 2\pi \frac{\lambda_\text{d}}{\lambda_\nu}, \]
%
where $\lambda_\text{d} = 50$~m and $\lambda_\nu$ is the standard neutrino
oscillation length $\lambda_\nu = \Delta m^2/4E_\nu$. For $\xi\gg1$ the wave
packet is insufficiently broad to accommodate a coherence superposition of the
heavy and light neutrino states. We estimate that this occurs at 
%
\[  \Delta m^2 \gtrsim 20~\text{eV}^2. \] 
%
In this article we study the region of MeV scale sterile masses. These are
heavy enough to forbid oscillatory effects while light enough to be have
significant production from the meson decays associated with a conventional
neutrino beam. 

The observable signature in this model is the direct decay-in-flight of the new
fermion into SM particles. In the minimal \lagrangian\ in
\refeq{eq:minimallag}, the only direct couplings to new sterile fermions are
neutrino Higgs interactions. However, these couplings generate off-diagonal
neutrino bilinears below the electroweak symmetry breaking scale, which leads
to mass mixing between the $4+$ flavours of neutrinos. This generates
production and decay mechanisms of many kinds for the state $\ster$ through
mass insertion on an active neutrino fermion line in a gauge mediated process.
These decays have been studied extensively in the literature \cite{Atre:2009rg}
and depend only on the size of neutrino mixing to various flavours,
parameterized by the elements of an extended $4\times4$ PMNS matrix,
%
\[ U_{e4}, \qquad U_{\mu 4} \qquad \text{and} \qquad U_{\tau 4},  \]
%
and the mass of the state $\ster$ itself. The branching ratios for these decays
are shown in \reffig{fig:branchingratios} as a function of mass for the case if
the new state mixes with all flavours of active neutrino equally $U_{e4}=U_{\mu
4}=U_{\tau 4}$. The main effect of the flavour structure is to forbid certain
decays which require certain elements of the mixing matrix. This, in turn,
affects the possible production mechanisms for these particles. In a
conventional neutrino beam, most neutrinos are derived from meson decay (or
secondary $\mu^\pm$ decays). If $U_{e4}=U_{\mu 4}=0$, such decays with a mass
insertion for the sterile neutrino are impossible for pions or kaons.For this
reason, we will mainly focus on mixing with the first two generations. This
parameter space will be probed by working at higher energies, where the neutral
fermions can be produced by decays of charmed mesons such as $D^\pm$, by the
SHiPS experiment \cite{Alekhin:2015byh, Anelli:2015pba}.   

We focus on five decays in our study, which have the largest branching ratios
of all channels with visible decay products over the mass range producable from
pion and kaon decay, $m_{\ster} \lesssim m_K$.

\begin{align*}
	\pi^\pm / K^\pm \longrightarrow \overbrace{l^\pm \ster}^{\text{via } U_{e4} \text{ or } U_{\mu 4}}  &\longrightarrow  l^\pm \pi^\mp, \\
						& \drsh \nu_\alpha e^+ e^-, \\
						& \drsh \nu_\alpha \gamma, \\
						& \drsh \nu_\alpha \pi^0. \\
\end{align*}

decays in the minimal 3 sterile SM extension, with masses between 1 MeV and 0.5

to the very small componant of heavier mesons in the secondary beam. This plot
assumes equal mixing with all active flavours. Note that below 100 MeV, $\ster
\rightarrow \nu_\alpha e^+ e^-$ is by far the most dominant visible decay.}
%
\end{figure}

\subsection{Minimal model}

We define the minimal sterile neutrino model by the Lagrangian in
\refeq{eq:minimallag}. This corresponds to the best known model of sterile
neutrino phenomenology: the UV-complete Type I see-saw. Decays of sterile
neutrinos in such a model have been studied in \refref{Atre:2009rg}, and we
briefly summarize the important results.

For sterile neutrino masses less than the pion mass, the dominant visible decay
will be into an electron-positron pair as can be seen from
\reffig{fig:branchingratios}. This is true regardless of the flavour structure
of the mixing matrix. The decay rate for this channel is given by 
%
\[ \Gamma\left(\ster\to \nu_i e^+e^-\right) =
\frac{G_\text{F}^2m_\ster^5}{96\pi^3}I_1\left(0,\frac{m_e}{m_\ster},\frac{
m_e}{m_\ster}\right).  \]
%
where \begin{align} I_1(x,y,z) & =12 \int_{(x+y)^2}^{(1-z)^2}
\frac{ds}{s}(s-x^2-y^2)(1+z^2-s)\sqrt{\lambda(s,x^2,y^2)}\sqrt{\lambda(1,s,z^2)},\\
\lambda(a,b,c) &= a^2+b^2+c^2 - 2ab-2bc-2ca.  \end{align}
%
Decays of this type would generally fall into two categories of events at a LAr
detector, and accordingly we divide our analysis. The first event sample will
attempt to measure events where two tracks are resolved and two
electron-induced electromagnetic showers are observed.
%
The second sample consists of events for which the identification of two
electron-like showers is impossible. In this case, the signal would be identical
to a single photon pair-conversion. We expect a larger background for this
scenario, but as we will show, we get sizable event numbers in this channel due
to the sterile neutrino's high energy, and a tight cut on the angular
distribution can make it sensitive to sterile decays.

Also possible at these low masses, the radiative decay
$\ster\to\nu_i\gamma$ would generate an interesting single photon
signal \cite{PhysRevD.25.766}. In the minimal model the decay rate goes as
%
\[ \Gamma(\ster\to\nu_i\gamma) = \frac{G_\text{F}^2m_\ster^5 |U_{\alpha 4}|^2}{192 \pi^3} \left( \frac{27 \alpha}{32 \pi} \right), \]
%
this decay channel will be very smal and the total decay rate can be estimated
at around $\Gamma(\ster\to\nu_i\gamma)/(\text{GeV}) \approx 10^{-20}
(m_\ster/\text{GeV})^5$.  

When the mass of the sterile neutrino is greater than the kinematic threshold
for the production of a neutral pion, a new decay dominates $\ster\to\nu_i
\pi^0$. The decay rate for this process is given by
%
\[ \Gamma\left(\ster \to \nu_i \pi^0\right) =
\frac{G_\text{F}^2f_\pi^2m_\ster^3}{64\pi} \left[1-\left( \frac{m_\pi}{m_\ster}
\right)^2\right].  \]

The next channel appears at the kinematic threshold for charged pion production
with a charged lepton. If mixing between the heavy mass state and the electron
neutrino is present, this decay occurs almost immediately after the $\nu\pi^0$
channel opens. However, if this mixing is negligible, there is a gap the size of
the muon mass before the $\mu^\pm\pi^\mp$ channel opens. As can be seen from
\reffig{fig:branchingratios}, these decays dominate the visible decays when
they are allowed. These decays have a similar scaling behaviour of the decay
rate to the $\nu\pi^0$ channel with an equivalent dependence on the pion
structure constant,
%
\[ \Gamma\left(\ster\to l^\pm\pi^\mp\right) =
	\left|U_{l4}\right|^2\frac{G_\text{F}^2f_\pi^2 |V_{ud}|^2  m_\ster^3}{16\pi}I\left(\frac{m_l^2}{m_\pi^2} , \frac{m_\ster^2}{m_\pi^2}\right) ,
\]
with 
\[
	I(x,y) = \left[ \left( 1+x+y\right) \left(1+x\right) -4 x\right] \lambda^\frac{1}{2}\left(1,x,y\right)
\]

As can be seen from \reffig{fig:branchingratios} there are several additional
decays possible $\ster\rightarrow \nu_\alpha \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $\ster
\rightarrow \nu_\alpha e^+ \mu^-$, however, in the kinematic region allowed
under the assumption the steriles were produced in pion and kaon decays these
channels have sub dominant branching ratios and are not included in this
analysis.

\subsection{Non-minimal models}

An important feature of the minimal model that we have discussed so far is the
all or nothing approach to decay rates: all decay processes of the sterile
neutrino are weak processes scaled by a mixing matrix element. 
%
Therefore it is the three mixing matrix elements $U_{\alpha 4}$ which dictate
the magnitude of all the decay rates. This is a great asset when trying to
constrain the  minimal model, for example it allows us to convert any
non-observation of a signal into a bound on the mixing matrix, and allows us to
reinterpret bounds on any one decay rate onto the expected decay rates for
other channels, such as $\ster \rightarrow \nu_\alpha e^+ e^-$ non-observation
being used to bound $\ster \rightarrow \nu_\alpha \pi^0$ despite no experiment
to-date reporting the results of such a search. 
%
However, this asset becomes a bias when used in a general search for novel
neutral states. Although such low-scale see-saws are a viable region of
parameter space, they lack a theoretically appealing mechanism to explain the
sub-electroweak sterile neutrino mass scale nor the sizes of neutrino masses.
Although alternative models exist which can provide a light neutral particle
and a mechanism to generate light neutrino masses, they rely on extended field
content or interactions.
%
Indeed it has been stressed before that a light sterile neutrino would be a
sign of some non-trivial new physics \cite{delAguila:2008ir}. To exploit the
most general constraints on the low-energy approximation to the full theory we
use effective field theory. The effective field theory of a SM extension
involving new sterile fermions has been presented at dimension 5
\cite{delAguila:2008ir,Aparici:2009fh}, dimension 6 \cite{delAguila:2008ir} and
dimension 7 \cite{Bhattacharya:2015vja}.
%
In \refref{Aparici:2009fh} the phenomenology of the effective operators at
dimension 5 are considered in detail. Along with the Weinberg operator, which
could be the source of a light neutrino Majorana mass term
\cite{Weinberg:1979sa}, the authors find two effective operators: an operator
coupling the sterile neutrino to the Higgs doublet and a tensorial coupling
between the sterile neutrino and the hypercharge field strength 
%
\[ \mathcal{L}_5 \supset \frac{c_1}{\Lambda}\overline{\ster^c}\ster(H^\dagger H) +
\frac{c_2}{\Lambda}\overline{\ster^c}\sigma^{\mu\nu}\ster B_{\mu\nu}. \] 
%
At energies below the electroweak scale, and after diagonalisation into mass
eigenstates for the neutrinos, these operators generate novel couplings, for
example a vertex allowing $\ster\to h \nu$ ($\ster_1\to h \ster_2$) or $\ster\to \nu Z$
($\ster_1\to Z \ster_2$) at a rate governed by the scale of new physics suppressing
these operators. See also \refref{Duarte:2016miz} for a discussion of decay
rates in the effective sterile neutrino extension up to dimension 6.

\newtext{PB}{Some comment on Gninenko:} $\ster\to \nu \gamma$: However, in a
non-minimal model this decay rate could be enhanced. For example, such an
enhancement has been proposed to resolve the MiniBooNE anomaly
\cite{Gninenko:2009ks,Gninenko:2010pr}. 



Although effective models of sterile neutrino decay can describe the low-scale
effects of high-scale physics, their predictions are invalid if unidentified
light degrees of freedom exist in the model. For example, models with sterile
neutrinos that also feature novel interactions can have significantly different
decay rates and branching fractions, strengthening some bounds and invalidating
others \cite{Batell:2016zod,Ballett:2016xxx}.
%
As an example, a model with a leptophilic $Z^\prime$ \cite{Foot:1994vd} could
enhance purely leptonic decay rates, such as $\ster\to \nu e^+\mu^-$, while not
enhancing semileptonic processes like $\ster\to e^\pm \pi^\mp$.  \marcom{PB}{Check
this reference. It is $\mu$-$\tau$, does what I say make sense?}


There are two points that are worth making about non-minimal models of sterile
decay.  Firstly, for any one channel, reporting the results of the
non-observation of certain decay products in terms of a mixing matrix element
is mostly harmless. We can always see this as an effective quantity
representing the rate of suppression compared to the minimal model with order 1
mixing terms. Therefore, no existing conclusions are altered. However,
correlations between channels must be given up: we can no longer assume that
the effective mixing angle for one channel is equal to the effective mixing
angle of another. This means that some channels are much more poorly
constrained than it might seem from the published bounds. For example, to the
best of our knowledge, no beam dump experiment to-date has placed bounds on
$\ster\to \nu\gamma$ or $\ster\to\nu\pi^0$; indeed, although the former channel has
bounds from tests of neutrino electromagnetic properties, the latter is bounded
to a fair weaker degree. 

Secondly, in any extended model the minimal couplings are still present. This
is an unavoidable consequence of mass-mixing between the active and sterile
sectors and the interactions of the SM. Therefore, without suspicious
cancellations (or significant destructive interference) between the
mixing-derived and higher-dimensional contributions to a decay, the
non-observation of a signal in a given decay channel can still be used to bound
the mixing matrix element, and therefore the minimally-correlated bounds
\emph{do} apply to the Standard Model + mixing decay processes. 

For the reasons discussed so far, we believe it is relevant to place bounds on
the possible decays of a neutral fermion in an extended scheme which allows for
arbitrary decay rates to visible particles (within the bounds of perturbativity
and other conventional model building constraints).
%
We will focus here on the posibility for enlarged neutral current decay rates
of the mostly-sterile fermion. In this scenario, the production of the sterile
state will be largely unaffected by the new physics: heavy states will be
produced in the beam from meson decay as usual. However, we allow for an
increased rate of decay for the two channels $\Gamma_{\gamma\nu}$ and
$\Gamma_{\pi^0\nu}$.
%
When considering these enlarged decay rates, we must be careful with existing
bounds on the model, as an enlarged decay rate would affect all prior beam dump
experiments in the same way until the point where baseline dependence becomes
significant.

\caption{\label{fig:timing} Shown above is the timing delay of sterile neutrino
decays in nano-seconds for both a 25 MeV (top) and 350 MeV (bottom) sterile

respectively). The 2 ns beam bucket window is shown highlighted in red from 0
to 2 ns, followed by an additional 19 ns gap. The timings are calculated as a
difference to the time of flight of a active neutrino, assuming the decay
occurred in a uniform sample across the 50m BNB decay pipe. A timing resolution
of 1 ns is assumed to smear the observed events. }
%
\end{figure}

One of the interesting features of the SBN complex is the interplay of the
three detectors, operating similar technology but situated at different
baseline distances. Light neutrinos propagate and reach the furthest detector
of the SBN complex after around 2 $\mu$s. In the conventional physics programme
of the SBN, the timing of these events play an important role in the analysis
of backgrounds, tight timing windows are placed around the 19.2$\mu$s beam
spill to limit constant rate backgrounds such as cosmogenic events.i Both SBND
and ICARUS, however, are expected to be able to achieve significantly better
timing resolution $\mathcal{O}$(1 ns), which allows for the use of both bucket
and spill structure in the background analysis. The BNB consists of 81
Radio-Frequency buckets of approximately 2ns length, separated by 19 ns, to
form the 19.2$\mu$s spill with a frequency of 3Hz \cite{Antonello:2015ea}.
Nano-second resolution allows for events in individual buckets to be
identified. \muboone\ is omitted from this analysis as the achievable timing
resolution is worse, $\approx 10$ns.

As particles with finite rest mass, these heavy neutral leptons will propagate
at subluminal speeds and for larger masses can produce observable timing
delays. This effect begins to become relavent when the sterile neutrinos are of
MeV-scale masses and above. As the flux of decaying sterile is inversely
proportional to energy, we expect many of these low energy steriles to be
traveling at significantly slower speeds than their light counterparts. Shown
in \reffig{fig:timing_line} below is the fraction of events that are expected
to fall outside the 4ns bucket window in both SBND and ICARUS, with detailed
timing spectrums of a 25 and 350 MeV sterile shown in \ref{fig:timing}.

For the lighter sterile masses around $25$ MeV, a significant fraction of decay
events will end up in the beam timing window, defined to be 1ns surrounding the
2ns bucket, and must be analysed as a signal on top of the beam-related
backgrounds in the standard analysis. At $m_{\ster}=350$ MeV, we see that while
many events still fall in the in beam timing window, both detectors see
significant deviation from this with a large fraction of events populating the
inter-RF-bucket spacing where one would expect to see extremely reduced
beam-correlated backgrounds. \\ \begin{figure}[t]

(dashed) lines. Both SBND and ICARUS see a sizable fraction of total events
outside the beam bucket windows when the sterile mass exceeds $\approx100$ MeV.
The solid horizontal line corresponds to the percentage ($\approx 81$\%) if the
events were uniformly distributed in time. (Running with more stats as we
speak, but I do think its a good plot to have in some form or another)  }
%
\end{figure}


The implication of the timing effects is that our discussion of backgrounds is
twofold: for low mass steriles, or any mass at \muboone\ due to timing
resolution, we must consider all beam-related backgrounds as potential
backgrounds. For larger masses at SBND and ICARUS, we may instead eliminate all
signal events that lie in the bucket window and their associated beam-driven
backgrounds and consider how to isolate the remaining signal events from the
non-beam related background, predominately from cosmogenic events.

\section{Simulation details}

A crucial aspect of estimating the sensitivity of the SBN to sterile decays is
accurate modeling of the incoming sterile fluxes. We have computed the fluxes
and simulated event numbers for each beam and detector via a custom Monte Carlo
program. The program allows efficiency's to be taken into account due to
experimental details of the detector such as energy and timing resolution in a
fully correlated way between observables. To leading order in the mass of the
sterile neutrino over the pion, the fluxes for the $\ster$ will be a rescaling
of the fluxes for the active neutrinos.  We take these neutrino fluxes as our
input and scale them by the appropriate mixing $U_{\alpha 4}$, with an
additional kinematic factor to take into account the helicity un-suppression of
channels such as $\pi^+ \rightarrow e^+\ster$ for massive $\ster \gg m_e$. The
flux of steriles produced from the decay of a meson M is therefore given by
%
\[
	\phi_{\ster}(E_{\ster}) \approx \phi_{\nu_\alpha} (E_{\nu_\alpha})\vert U_{\alpha 4}\vert^2 \frac{\rho\left( \delta_M^a , \delta_M^i \right)}{\delta_M^a \left(1- \delta_M^a\right)^2}.
\]
%
Where $\rho(a,b)=\mathcal{F}_M(a,b) \lambda^{\frac{1}{2}}(1,a,b)$ is a
kinematic factor consisting of a term proportional to the two body phase space
factor, $\lambda(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2+z^2-2(x y+yz+x z)$ and a term proportional to
the matrix element, $\mathcal{F}_M(a,b)= a+b -\left(a-b\right)^2$, with
$\delta_M^{a(i)}=m_{l_a(\nu_i)}^2/M^2$ \cite{PhysRevD.24.1232}. This kinematic
effect for the pion and kaon can be substantial, in the case of $\pi
\rightarrow e \nu$ this factor can be up to $10^5$, which more than compensates
for the significantly smaller flux of $\nu_e$  inherent in the BNB. We only
consider steriles below the kinematic threshold of the kaon (388 MeV for
production via $|U_{\mu4}|$ mixing and 493 MeV for $|U_{e4}|$ driven
production) as although there is a small component of heavier mesons such as
the D meson which could produce heavier sterile states, they are produced in
very small numbers due to the relatively low energy protons of the BNB beam. As
the mass of the sterile increases, we begin to see components of the flux
having energies less that the sterile mass, artificially loosing these events
from the beam. In order to keep the normalisation of total neutrino events
constant, before $U_{\alpha 4}$ and kinematic scaling, these events are shifted
to be above the sterile mass threshold. \\

The neutrino fluxes at all three SBN detectors are calculated from published
MiniBooNE fluxes \cite{AguilarArevalo:2008yp}, after scaling by appropriate
$1/r^2$ baseline dependence, e.g $(470/540)^2 \approx 1.3$ at \muboone. This
is similarly scaled by $1/r^2$ for ICARUS at 600m, however, an additional
energy dependant flux modifier is applied for SBND at 110m to account for the
softer energy spectrum due to the proximity of the detector to the production
target \cite{Antonello:2015lea}. We consider sources of neutrinos that are
relavent including wrong sign neutrinos, smaller sub-dominant $K^+\rightarrow
\pi^+\rightarrow \nu_\alpha$ as well as other contributions, predominately from
meson decay chains initiated by meson-nucleus interactions, although all
contributions other than neutrinos from two body meson decays are scaled by
$|U_{\alpha 4}|^2$ only, not including the kinematic enhancement mentioned
above. The neutrino spectrum at \muboone\ is shown below in figure
(\ref{fig:nuflux}). As the probability for any given sterile to decay scales as
$1/E_{\ster}$, the fluxes at low energy are of particular importance.

energy bins, where traditionally cross-section induced background effects are
small.}

\begin{figure}[t]

\end{figure}

Given the spectral flux of sterile neutrinos in the BNB as calculated above,
$\mathrm{d}\phi/\mathrm{d}E$, we compute the total number of accepted events in
channel ``$\text{c}$'' via the following summation,
%
\[ \ster_\text{c} = \sum_{i} \left .
\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}E}\right|_{E_i} P_\text{D}\left(E_i\right)
W_\text{c}\left(E_i\right),  \]
%
where $P_\text{D}(E)$ is the probability for a sterile of that energy to reach
and then decay inside the detector labelled $\text{D}$. The simplest
approximation is to ignore all geometric effects, so that every particle
travels exactly along the direction of the beam line, which gives the following
probability 
%
\[ P_\text{D}\left(E\right) = e^{-\frac{\Gamma_\text{T}L}{\gamma\beta}}\left(
1-
e^{-\frac{\Gamma_\text{T}\lambda}{\gamma\beta}}\right)\frac{\Gamma_\text{c}}{\Gamma_\text{T}},
\label{eq:prob} \]
%
where $\Gamma_\text{T}$ ($\Gamma_\text{c}$) denotes the rest-frame total decay
width (decay width into channel $\text{c}$), $m$ the mass of the sterile
neutrino, and $L$ ($\lambda$) the distance to (width of) the detector. The
combination $\gamma\beta$ is the usual special relativistic function of
velocities of the parent particle and provides the sole energy dependence of
the expression
%
\[   \frac{1}{\gamma\beta} \equiv \frac{m}{\sqrt{E^2-m^2}}. \]
%
As we are exploring a large parameter space, often this expression takes a
simplified form depending on the size of $\Gamma_\text{T}\lambda/\gamma\beta$:
%
\begin{align} 
%
\Gamma_\text{T}\lambda \ll 1\qquad&\qquad P_\text{D} \approx
e^{-\frac{\Gamma_\text{T}L}{\gamma\beta}}\frac{\Gamma_\text{c}\lambda}{\gamma\beta}
+ \mathcal{O}\left(\Gamma_\text{T}^2\lambda^2\right),\label{eq:prob_dec1}\\
%
\Gamma_\text{T}\lambda \gg 1\qquad&\qquad P_\text{D} \approx
e^{-\frac{\Gamma_\text{T}L}{\gamma\beta}}\frac{\Gamma_\text{c}}{\Gamma_\text{T}}
+ \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\Gamma_\text{T}\lambda}\right), \label{eq:prob_dec2}
%
\end{align}
%
where the rate for slowly decaying particles can be seen to grow with detector
size until a width of $\lambda\sim\Gamma_\text{c}^{-1}$ where longer detectors
make no difference, as most steriles decay within a few decay lengths and
therefore we see a fixed fraction of the total events in our channel of
interest. 

%
Finally, the function $W_\text{c}(E)$ is a weighting factor which accounts for
all effects which reduce the number of events in the sample: for example,
analysis cuts or detector performance effects.
%
To compute these factors, we run a Monte Carlo simulation of the decays for a
large number of sample events with a given energy. Each sterile event is
associated with a decay of type $\text{c}$. We then apply experimental analysis
cuts to the decays based on our assumptions about the detector's capabilities
and backgrounds, to produce a spectrum representing the final event sample. The
percentage of accepted events defines the weight factor for that energy. As such the full spectral shape of the signal is included in the rate analysis. As a consistency check of our methodology, we reproduce in Appendix (\ref{sec:ps191}) some
the published bounds of PS-191. 

\section{Sensitivities\label{sec:sensitivity}}
%
The results of our analysis are shown in \reffig{fig:band_sbn} below for the
combined SBN facility, and in \reffig{fig:band_sbn} for \muboone\ for 6.6e20
POT, corresponding to 3 years running data . The lower colored lines show the
results of a backgroundless search, corresponding to the theoretical best
achievable sensitivity at the facility, assuming perfect signal efficiency. The
results of a simple cut based background analysis is also included as the upper
colored line. This background analysis is not optimsed, however, and serves
primarily to show the potential impact of backgrounds, see Appendix
(\ref{sec:bg}) for details of the backgrounds included in this analysis. We
estimate the true achievable sensitivity in each channel would lie somewhere
between these two curves (the solid shaded region). The analysis only considers
the total number of events in each channel, with the 90\% C.L defined as $2.44$
events, following the procedure of \refref{Feldman:1997qc} designed for
backgroundless searches for rare events. For the backgroundless search the
representative quantity $S/\sqrt{B}$ is contoured for a direct comparason.  \\

As can be seen SBN potentially sees significantly more events that PS-191, and
thus could improve the bounds for large sections of parameter space in all
channels and on all mixing elements. \muboone\ is slightly better than the
corresponding PS191 bounds for low mass steriles (due to the lower energy
neutrino spectrum) and approximately equal at higher masses. The previously
unbounded $\ster \rightarrow \nu_\alpha \pi^0$ can potentially be bounded at a
level very similar to the previous PS-191 $e^+ e^-$ channel.

\section{\label{sec:modelcomp}Model comparison at the SBN complex}

%1. intro
Given the existing anomalies in short baseline neutrino experiments, including
MiniBooNE which operated in the Booster beamline, the possibility of seeing an
anomalous signature at the SBN complex should not be ignored. There are
competing theoretical explanations for existing excesses: oscillatory sterile
neutrinos \cite{Everyone...}, neutrino decay \cite{Pascoli, Schwetz}, neutrino
production and decay inside the detector \cite{Gninenko, Meloni, Us?}. Taking
this as motivation, we consider here the important characteristics of the
decay-in-flight model.

In particular we contrast it to another model of excess events which may be
relevant to SBN.
%
The model of Gninenko \cite{Gninenko:2009ks,Gninenko:2010pr} which seeks to
explain the MiniBooNE excess through the production and decay of a new sterile
fermion inside the detector, has received significant attention in the
literature. This model introduces a short-lived sterile neutrino, which is
produced via a mixing-mediated neutral current interaction inside the detector,
and which decays into a single photon on a very fast timescale. This model
would necessitate a non-miminal model to allow for a large transition magnetic
moment to drive the decay. 

Although relinquishing the connection to the MiniBooNE anomaly, we can
generalize this model to produce a wider range of signals in the SBN facility.
Sterile neutrinos are still assumed to be produced inside the detector by
neutral current interactions between incoming active neutrinos and nuclei. The
steriles then quickly decay into SM particles via enhanced non-minimal decay
rates.
%
The model is very similar to the decay-in-flight model discussed in this paper,
but occupies another extreme of the parameter space.


%3. models to be distinguished between
% \subsection{Comparison between sterile neutrino oscillations and decays in flight}
% 
% The oscillatory sterile explanation of low-energy anomalies in neutrino data is
% theoretically appealing if not entirely phenomenologically convincing in its
% simplest incarnations. Either way, the SBN complex will be able to place
% important constraints on these models \cite{Antonello:2015lea}. With the
% purposes of our present study in mind, there is little chance that an
% oscillatory sterile could be confused by a MeV scale decaying sterile.  The
% signal for an oscillatory sterile would be a single electron, arising from a
% charged-current quasi-elastic processes.  There are no channels available to a
% decaying sterile neutrino which could produce such a signal without an
% additional (charged) particle. 
% 
% There is also a strong difference in the baseline dependence which may be
% visible at SBN. \newtext{PB}{It feels a bit pointless to fill this section
% out.}
% 
\subsection{Signal spectra}

As mentioned before, models of decay-in-flight tend to produce spectra which
are peaked at lower energies. This is due to the $1/E_\nu$ energy dependence from
the decay width, as shown in 

Although both models produce visible particles through sterile neutrino decay
in flight, the additional neutral current cross-section required by the
Gninenko-type sterile suppresses the lowest energy events. As can be seen in
\reffig{fig:XXX}, we see a marked difference between these signals at SBND. If
we factor in the cut-based analysis that was performed in the preceeding
section, we see that the model in this paper does lose a significant number of
events from the lowest bins. To separate these events cleanly, the analysis
should be optimised to keep as many of these lowest energy events as possible. 

\subsection{\label{sec:timing_physics}Timing for model discrimination}

In addition to being able to reduce beam-related backgrounds by studying the
inter-bucket windows, the timing of the observed events can also be used to
discriminate between different models, as well as give an independant
measurement of the sterile mass that avoids the need for any normalisation. This is a very important tool, being valid in both the minimal model as described above but also in extensions in which the total rate has additional parameters allowing decoupling of the mass from the new degrees of freedom. 
Elementary special relativity tells us that for an arrival time delay (behind a luminal particle) over a
distance $L$ denoted by $\Delta T$, the mass of a sterile neutrino with an
energy $E$ can be reconstructed as 
%
\[ m_{\ster} = E\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{\left(1+\frac{c\Delta T}{L}\right)^2}}. \]

To determine the prospects for measuring $m_{\ster}$ using this information we
have generated Monte Carlo event data tagging each event by an arrival time.
We account for a systematic uncertainty associated with the time measurement as
well as the energy reconstruction. We smear energy to represent detector
effects as described above, and aditional smear the time of each event with a
finite time resolution of $\sigma_T  \approx 1$ for SBND and ICARUS. As the
absolute timing of the event is not known, only the relative timing since the
last bucket, $\Delta T$, one can obtain up to 81 degenerate solutions for the
sterile mass from any given event depending on the placement in he spill
structure. By only studying the initial few buckets one can elleviate the
problem, however, it also reduces the signal statistics by $\mathcal{O}$(0.01)
and so this edge effect information is ignored in this analysis. \\

To estimate the sensitivity of the decaying sterile mass we have run a binned Maximum Liklihood analysis of the reconstructed sterile energy and $\Delta T$, assuming events are poission distributed. As we do not wish to consider normalisation we assume that the experiment, here ICARUS, observes 100 events consistant with $\nu_N\rightarrow e^- \pi^+$ decay in flight.We define our test statistic as \[
	t_m = -2 \ln \left(\mathcal{L}\right) =  2 \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ \mu_i(m)-n_i +n_i \ln(\frac{n_i}{\mu_i(m)})  \right]
\]
where $\mu_i(m)$ is the expected number of events in bin $i$ if the sterile is of mass m, then the reconstructed mass defined as the mass which minimises $t_m$. As many bins contain low if any events, as well as the cyclic nature of $\Delta T$ we have elected to perform a Monte Carlo estimation of the distribution of $t_m$ simulating the entire experiment many thousand times in order to account for any non-gaussianity. The results of this study are shown in Fig (\ref{fig:tof_scatter}) below in the form of 1 and 2 $\sigma$ ranges of reconstructed sterile mass as a function of true simulated mass. Resolution of approx 40 MeV at 1$\sigma$ is achievable for the entire range of sterile mass allowed. The  $\nu_N\rightarrow \mu^- \pi^+$ channel is approximaly 10\% better due to the better energy resolution of muons in LAr. The remaining channels $\nu_N\rightarrow \nu_\alpha \pi^0$, $\nu_N\rightarrow \nu_\alpha e^+ e^-$ and $\nu_N\rightarrow \nu_\alpha \gamma$ have essentially no resolution via timing alone due to the inability to reconstruct the entire sterile energy.

\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we have studied its capabilities of the Fermilab Short-Baseline
neutrino facility to constrain decaying sterile neutrinos with masses around
the MeV scale. To make a fair assessment of the potential to constrain these
models, we have performed a simple cut-based analysis of the dominant
backgrounds and signals and shown that in conjunction with accurate timing
measuremnts high levels of background suppression can be expected resulting in
close to backgroundless searches in all channels studied. Using these
background estimates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis to the
parameters of the minimal extension of the SM with a novel sterile neutrino.
Despite having significntly lower statistics than the full SBN, we show
\muboone\ could be sensitive to such decays and any observation would
correspond to a strong signal in both SBN and ICARUS when they later come
online.  We have also motivated searches for non-minimal models, which in
particular could lead to observable decays over a wide range of parameter space
which is conventionally excluded by theoretical assumptions on the decay rates
themselves. We argue that these decay rates are actually \emph{unconstrained}
in published work, and show that the SBN could place the first direct bounds on
these processes.

\section{Potential Backgrounds\label{sec:bg}}

In order to estimate the effect of expected backgrounds on the sensitivity we
have performed a Monte-Carlo analysis using the neutrino event generator GENIE
(cite GENIE). This provides us with generator level information about the
kinematics of the beam-driven backgrounds, with rates normalised off expected
NC and CC inclusive values as published in the SBN proposal. Energy and angular
smearing is then implemented to allow for approximate estimates of the effects
of detector performance to the level necessary for this analysis, without the
need for a full GEANT detector simulation. Energies are smeared according to a
Gaussian distribution around their true MC energies, with a relative variance
$\sigma_E/E = \xi/ \sqrt(E) $, where $\xi$ is a detector dependant resolution.
For this study we take the energy resolution for EM showers, muons and protons
to be 15\%, 6\% and a conservative 15\% respectively. We take the angular
resolution of LAr to be $1^{\circ}$. 

Of utmost importance in all studied channels to distinguishing signal and
background is the identification of a scattering vertex. Any hadronic activity
localized at the beginning of the lepton track is a smoking gun signal for beam
related scattering from deep-inelastic or quasi-elastic scattering. Therefore
any event containing one or more reconstructed protons or additional hadrons is
rejected outright. For counting this proton multiplicity we assume an detection
threshold of 21 MeV on proton kinetic energy in liquid Argon, after smearing.
Background events that contain less than this and events that do not contain
any protons, such as events originating from coherent pion production, remain a
viable background and further rejection must come from the kinematics of the
final state particles only. 

All two body visible decays discussed below have a powerful discriminator in
the reconstructed invariant mass of the charged particle pair, e.g  $M_{l^\pm
\pi^\mp}^2=m_l^2+m_{p^\pm}^2+ 2(E_l E_\pi - |P_l||P_\pi|\cos\theta_\text{sep})$
for $\ster\rightarrow \pi^+ l^-$, which sum to that of the the parent sterile
(within detector resolution), where as the background is expected form a broad
spectra spanning the energies of incoming neutrino. Additionaly, two body
decays allow for reconstruction of the parent sterile angle with respect to the
beamline which is assumed to be close to on-axis, unlike the more isotropic
backgrounds. We found $\approx 95$\% of reconstructed sterile from two bodys
decays were below $4^\circ$ relative to the beamline and we cut all events
greater than this.

expected differences between decay and scattering behaviour. }

\subsection{$\ster \rightarrow \mu^\pm \pi^\mp$ and $\ster \rightarrow e^\pm \pi^\mp$   }

The dominant backgrounds to the sterile decays we are interested in will be
genuine $\pi$-lepton production associated with the neutrino beam. So-called
CC1$\pi^+$ events are defined as the associated production of a charged pion
from the standard CC process which produces a lepton. These events can be
produced incoherently, often with large hadronic activity, or from coherent
scattering, where the neutrino scatters from the whole nucleus. These coherent
interactions tend to produce more forward decay products and will be another
significant source of backgrounds. Coherent cross-sections for these processes
have been studied in MiniBooNE \cite{Wascko:2006tx}, \minerva
\cite{Eberly:2014mra} and lately T2K and cross-sections appear to agree with
Monte Carlo calculations based on the Rein-Sehgal model \cite{Rein:2006di,
Rein:1982pf}.  Such a low $Q^2$ process tends to favour daughter pions and
muons that are forward going, kinematically very similar to decays in flight,
as well as no observable nuclear activity and as such are a potent
background.\\ 

The expected numbers of $e \pi$ events in the SBN detectors is significantly
smaller than that of the $\mu \pi$ channel, as the fraction of intrinsic
$\nu_e$ in the BNB beam is of $\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ level in comparison to
$\nu_\mu$. However, there will also be additional backgrounds to the $e \pi$
channel originating from the dominant $\nu_\mu$ beam. CC $\nu_\mu$ events which
contain an additional photon $(\mu+\gamma)$, or 1 reconstructed photon from a
$\pi^0$ decay, have the potential to be be mis-identified as an $(\pi e)$
event, provided the muon has a sufficiently short track length, $<$ 0.5 m, in
order to mimic a $\pi^-$. Additionally the photon must be mis-identified as an
electron, with an efficiency of 94\%, and furthermore, must convert to an
$e^+e^-$ pair close enough to the interaction vertex as so there is no visible
gap. Thus we accept 6\% of all CC $\mu+\gamma$ events whose photon converts
within 3cm, and whose muon track length is less than 0.5m. Combined with the
rejection of events with any vertex activity, this reduces the number of
background events to below that expected from intrinsic CC $\nu_e$ pion
production. As energy resolution for EM showers is lower than muons, the
invariant mass cut is less powerful requiring all events have an invariant mass
below 500 MeV. 

Additional kinematic cuts are selected to further decrease backgrounds. A cut
on lepton-pion opening angle, $\theta_{l \pi} < 40^\circ$ as well as indicidual
emission angles, $\theta_{l,\pi} < 80^\circ$, reduces the potential background
from 1,153,090 in SBND to approximately 323 events for $\mu^- \pi^+$.
\reffig{fig:mu_pi_cutflow} shows the background rejection capability of LAr as
each additional cut is implemented in \muboone, in comparason to a 350 MeV
sterile decay. The $e^- \pi^+$ channel is one of the cleanest channel under
consideration, with 9223 events in SBND reducing to 22 expected events post
cuts, and with \muboone\ and ICARUS expecting $\mathcal{O}(1)$ events from
beam driven backgrounds.


\subsection{$\ster \rightarrow \nu_\alpha e^+ e^-$ and $\ster \rightarrow \gamma \nu_\alpha$ }

A sufficiently boosted, and thus overlapping, $e^+e^-$ pair is topologically
indistinguishable from a converted photon in a LAr detector. Additional,
non-topological measures such as the rate of energy loss, $dE/dx$, is also
identical to a pair-converted photon. Thus we split this channel into two sub
categories, when the $e^+e^-$ is overlapping and photon-like, defined to be all
events whose angular separation is $\leq 3^\circ$\cite{Spitz:2011wba} and all
remaining separable two track events. The opening angle between the $e^+e^-$ in
a photon pair production scales roughly as $\approx m_e/E_\gamma$, with
$3^\circ$ corresponding to 100 MeV and used as a lower bound on energy. These
backgrounds are also applicable to the $\ster \rightarrow \nu_\gamma
\nu_\alpha$ channel.\\ 

Any standard process producing a lone stray photon is thus a possible source of
backgrounds for the photon-like $e^+e^-$ channel. The predominant source of
this in all three SBN detectors is the decay of a neutral pion in which a
single photon is not resolved or escapes the fiducial volume. This background,
however, is relatively isotropic in distribution and of lower energy that the
signal, in stark contrast to the very forward signal. Thus we apply a cut on
visible photon energy, $E_\gamma \geq 300 $ MeV and angle of the observed
photon to the beamline, $\theta_\gamma \leq 5^\circ$. In conjunction with the
requirement that no vertex activity is recorded, this reduced the number of
expected events from 42,580 to 176 events in SBND, while retaining a signal
efficiency of 93\%.

For the opposite scenario both daughter electrons have a well defined, and
large, separation and thus can cleanly be identified as two distinct single
electron showers. There are no significant processes that produce high energy,
distinguishable $e^+e^-$ pairs in a standrd neutrino beam.  Instead the
majority of the backgrounds are due to misidentifying photons, which are
abundant, as electrons. This can either be a single photon alongside a CC $e^-$
event or the more common NC $\pi^0$ production in which both of the underlying
photons are mis-identified as electrons. As both of these backgrounds require
the photons to mimic electrons originating from a single decay vertex, we also
require that all photons pair convert within 3cm of the start of the electron
track in the case of CC $\nu_e$ backgrounds, or both photons convert within 3cm
of each other in the case of NC $\pi^0$ backgrounds. Further more, each event
passing the above cuts is rejected with a 94\% efficiency using measurements of
the rate of energy loss, $dE\/dx$. All remaining events are kept as
backgrounds. To further reject backgrounds we apply a cut on angle of
separation between the distinct $e^-e^-$ tracks of $\theta_\text{sep}\leq 40
^\circ$ and total energy, $E_{e^+}+E_{e^-} \geq 100$ MeV. This reduces the
number of expected backgrounds from 173 events to 5 events in SBND. 

\subsection{$\ster\rightarrow \pi^0 \nu_\alpha$}

Although a sub-dominant decay mode when steriles mix with electrons alone, when
one considers non-zero $\vert U_{\mu4}\vert^2$ the branching ratio of $\ster
\rightarrow \nu_\mu \pi^0$ becomes dominant for a mass window $\approx 140
\rightarrow 240$ MeV. There is no known experimental publication of $\ster
\rightarrow \nu_\alpha \pi^0$ in the literature, mainly due to the large
expected backgrounds. Single neutral pions are produced in great numbers at the
three SBN facilities, so the lack of any nuclear recoil is crucial in
eliminating the incoherent neutral pion production background. As the $\pi^0$
itself is not visible, we focus on the reconstructed pion energy and angle,
inferred from measuring the resultant photons energy and angle, smeared as
usual to model detector effects. Only events in which both photons convert
inside the fiducial volume are accepted. SBND expects 127,211 $\pi^0$ events,
of which $\approx 602$ survive all cuts with a signal efficiency of 32\% for a
sample 350 MeV sterile. \\ 

To summerise, we collect the total numbers of beam-induced background events
expected at the three SBN below in \reftab{tab:Rates}, both before and after we
apply all visible vertex and kinematic cuts as described above. One can see
that LAr provides an impressive level of background rejection, with \muboone
and ICARUS being close to backgroundless in many channels, and SBND expecting
only $\mathcal{O}(100)$ events in all channels.

\subsection{Non-Beam related backgrounds}

Cosmogenic backgrounds are expected to be significantly smaller in comparison
to beam related backgrounds. In the case of cosmic muons, \icarus\ expects to
see approximately $2.5 \times 10^{6}$ cosmic events in the 211 second beam
spill, and are reduced to approximately 5 events expected after utilizing the
spill structure, scintillation light patterns and cuts on $\frac{d E}{d x}$
\cite{Antonello:2015lea}.  Alongside this impressive cosmic rejection, our
signal events are focused heavily along the beamline, hence we do not expect
cosmics to be a major source of background to any channel. In situ beam-off
cosmic studies will also allow potential backgrounds to be extremely well
understood by the time of an analysis such as this, are so are not included in
this analysis. 

\section{PS-191 Bound Repoduction}

As a consistency check of our methodology we reproduce here the bounds on
$|U_{e4}|$ and $|U_{\mu 4}|$ for sterile masses below $m_\pi$ as published by
PS-191. The detector geometry is assumed to be $6\text{m} \times 3\text{m}
\times 12 \text{m}$ and was located 128m downstream of the Beryllium target
using 19.2 GeV protons from the PS proton beam.  Fluxes of all neutrinos
produced from pion sources at PS-191 were obtained from \cite{ps191THesis}. No
accurate kaon sources could be obtained and as such only low mass bounds are
reproduced here. It must be noted that PS-191 ignored all neutral current
contributions to $\ster \rightarrow \nu_\alpha e^+ e^-$ and assumed the sterile
neutrinos were Dirac particles; the effect of this is that the bounds published
are not directly comparable to the minimal model discussed above, and must be
scaled appropiately. The bounds reproduced are in good agreement with published
data.

\section{To do list}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Decide what statistical method to use? Do we do a spectral fit?

\item How does eventrate actually deal with spectra things? Can we modify it to 
do spectral plots or even fits?

\item \newtext{MARK}{Working on} Generagte efficiency file from above cuts.

\item \newtext{MARK}{Working on} Use the efficiency files from previous point to produce new plots of
sensitivity.

\item Implement $\nu\gamma$ decay rate. 

\item Compute plots for enhanced decay rates to unobserved channels. Check that
the enhanced $\Gamma$ code works.

\item Do a bit more checking that the `unobserved' channels are indeed unobserved.

\item Baseline dependence + event timing = physics? (Decide what we can do with
event ratios + scaling, or timing analysis).  \emph{e.g.} see figure
\ref{fig:baseline_comp}.

\item \newtext{MARK}{Converted to timing.cxx to integrate into the new inflight observabes that contains smearing} Timing scatterplots to distingush sterile masses, currently two mathematica notebooks with scatterplot and nautilus plot calculations on DropBox (not gitable).

\item Turn on $U_{\tau 4}$,$U_{\mu 4}$ and $U_{e4}$ simultaneously. Think of
how we can push the analysis beyond the obvious by using flavour effects. Also
look at ratios of channels and ratios of events to see if we can get any
(broken) degeneracies that could actually be interesting \emph{i.e} SNO style
complementary measurements.

\item Keep refining text. Add introduction; write sterile decay section; structure 
the simulation details section; write conclusions etc.

\item \newtext{MARK}{Working on} Make nice version of branching ratio plot. Need to make prettier. \sout{Also, we probably need to cut it off at 
	$M_\ster\lesssim 500$ MeV, there are other decays allowed between 0.5 and 1 GeV (with $\eta$ and $\rho$)}.

\item \newtext{MARK}{Working on} Think if there's a nice plot showing the sterile effect on our fluxes.
