\abstract{
%
We study the sensitivity of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) programme at
Fermilab to sterile neutrino decay in both a minimal extension and more generic
beyond the Standard Model scenarios. We provide estimates for the bounds that
the SBN can be expected to place on the parameter spaces of these models,
finding that the facility can in many cases extend existing bounds whilst, due
to the strong particle identification capabilities of liquid-Argon technology,
also place bounds on as yet unconstrained channels. 
%
We then compare the signals of decays in flight to other models with sterile
neutrinos.  We show that significant similarities exists between our spectral
shapes and a model with localised production and decay of sterile neutrinos.
%
We also show that the particular design of SBN, with three detectors at
different baselines, could allow for interesting signals associated to the
timing of events. This would provide a smoking gun signature of the MeV models
under consideration.

\section{Introduction}

The neutrino sector of the Standard Model (SM) is known to be incomplete. The
observation of oscillatory behaviour between neutrino flavour states suggests a
set of mass terms with relevant (flavour) off-diagonal terms. There are many
ways that have been suggested in the literature to explain neutrino masses from
a theoretical perspective, ranging from the popular see-saw scenarios to
radiative mass generation or even more involved constructions. It is ultimately
the role of phenomenology to find ways to distinguish between candidate models,
and see what can be learnt from the neutrino sector about the structure of BSM
physics.
%
Not all models, however, lend themselves to experimental searches. For example,
the canonical Type-I see-saw \cite{Minkowski:1977sc, GellMann:1980vs,
Mohapatra:1979ia} suggests the existence of new particles with masses around
$10^{12}$--$10^{15}$ GeV, well out of reach of modern experimental techniques.
One observable feature of some models is the presence of novel fermionic
singlets of the SM gauge group, which we shall refer to as sterile neutrinos.
These will generically mix with the `active' neutrinos of the SM and could
alter neutrino phenomenology at observable scales. 
%
A well known example of such an effect is the short-baseline disappearance
signature associated with a sterile neutrino with a mass around the eV scale
(see \eg\ \refref{Gariazzo:2015rra} for a recent review). Such a state would
produce oscillatory effects over short distances and has been invoked to solve
the anomalies found at some short-baseline oscillation experiments.  Explaining
all anomalies in an economical fashion appears challenging in these models
\cite{Kopp:2013vaa}, but more data would be needed before a decision can be
made as to their role in the neutrino sector.

In this article, we study a complementary paradigm to the oscillatory sterile
neutrino models where sterile neutrinos exist, are produced in neutrino beams,
but have masses sufficiently large to prevent oscillatory effects with the
active neutrinos through loss of coherence (see \eg\ \refref{Akhmedov:2009rb}).
Due to the presence of mixing effects, these particles are not generically
expected to be stable and their subsequent decays have been enumerated
\cite{Atre:2009rg} and searched for in many previous experiments.
%
Our focus will be on the role of the Fermilab SBN programme \cite{Antonello:2015lea}
for the search for sterile neutrinos of this type.
%
This experimental facility comprises of three separate detectors placed in the
Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at different (short) baseline distances: SBND
(previously known as LAr1-ND) at 110~m from the target, \muboone\ at 470~m and
ICARUS at 600~m.  All three detectors are filled with Liquid Argon (LAr)
giving unprecedented reconstruction and particle identification capabilities
allowing for significantly lower backgrounds than predecessor technologies. 
%
%\newtext{PB}{In addition to events arising from the BNB, the detectors of the
%SBN complex will also collect events associated with the NuMI beam, currently
%being used in the NO$\nu$A, MINER$\nu$A and MINOS+ experiments. This beam is
%off-axis with respect to the SBN detectors leading to significant kinematic
%differences.}
%
The SBN facility has a number of interesting features relevant to the search
for sterile neutrino decay:

\begin{enumerate}

\item The reconstruction and particle ID capabilities of LAr technology means
the SBN program provides an ideal scenario to study the decay in flight of
sterile neutrinos, a job which has traditionally been left for low-mass
detectors with corresponding low beam-related backgrounds. 
%
We will discuss how a very high level of background suppression can be obtained
through a simple cut-based analysis motivated by the kinematic properties
of a beam-based decay-in-flight signal. 

\item The three detectors allow for timing-based effects between 
the three detectors if the excess comes from a sterile neutrino decay 
model. As we will discuss in \refsec{sec:timing}, this means that a decaying 
sterile neutrino would have a very distinctive pattern of excess events at
SBN, unobservable to a facility with a single detector.

\item The excellent particle identification will allow for the investigation of
channels for which there are no published searches, only inferred bounds based
on minimal theoretical models. We will discuss extended models of sterile decay
where the minimal model correlations between decay channels do not hold. This
means that there are no published bounds on some channels, and a decay rate in
a traditionally excluded region could be observed at the SBN complex. In the
absence of signal, the facility could of course place the first bounds on these
signatures of new physics.

\end{enumerate}

\end{table}

Decaying heavy sterile neutrinos have been searched for at many experiments
since the early 1970s \cite{}. In the mass range of interest for SBN, the
strongest bounds on sterile which mix with electron and muon neutrinos come
from PS-191 \cite{Bernardi:1985ny}, which ran at CERN from 1983 to 1985. 
% 
We can estimate the sensitivity of the three SBN detectors and how they will
compare to PS-191 by a simple exposure calculation. PS-191 was located 128m
downstream of the target and $2.3^\circ$ (40 mrads) off axis, obtained $0.86
\times 10^{19}$ POT over the course of its run-time, and had a total detector
volume of $6\times3\times12 = 216 \text{m}^3$. The total number of events
scales as POT $\times$ Vol $\times$ $R^{-2}$ and we compare the three
facilities to PS-191 in \reftab{tab:exposure}. We see that all facilities expect
a larger exposure, with SBND seeing the largest enhancement by a factor of
around $40$.
%
In addition to the larger exposure, there is also an enhancement of the
expected decay events at SBN due to its lower beam energy. The steriles at SBN
are produced by the 8 GeV BNB beam and have a softer spectrum than those
produced by the 19.2 GeV proton synchrotron beam used at PS-191. The probability 
of sterile neutrino decay scales as $1/E_\nu$ and we would therefore expect the SBN
facilities to see more events than PS-191 for equivalent exposures. 

Despite the advantage of scale at SBN, backgrounds could limit the advantage
over PS-191. As alluded to before, PS-191 was purposefully built to search for
decays in flight of heavy fermions, and to minimize the background induced by
active neutrino scattering, the total mass of the detector was chosen to be
small (approximately $20$ ton). The SBN detectors, whose primary goal is to
study neutrino scattering, have significantly larger masses ($112$, $66.6$ and
$476$ tons respectively). We therefore expect SBN to not only see a greater
number of decay events than PS-191, but to also see a greater background. 
%
To understand the sensitivity of SBN to heavy sterile decay, we must therefore
show that background rejection capability of LAr is sufficiently well
understood. This will be the focus on \refsec{sec:bg}.

\section{Sterile neutrino decay}

A gauge-singlet fermion will generally be unobservable by all non-gravitational
means unless it mixes with the active neutrino sector. The presence of mixing
introduces a range of possible observable signatures depending on the magnitude
of the sterile mass and its mixing to the active sector. 

The most general renormalizable \lagrangian\ extending the SM to include a
single novel gauge-singlet fermion $N$ is given by
%
\begin{align}   \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_\text{SM} +
\overline{N}i\slashed{\partial}N+ \frac{\mu}{2} \overline{N^\text{c}}N  +
y_\alpha\overline{L}_\alpha\tilde{H} N + y_\alpha^*
\overline{N}\widetilde{H}^*L_\alpha,\label{eq:minimallag} \end{align}
%
where $y_\alpha$ denote Yukawa couplings and $\mu$ a Majorana mass term for
$N$. The extension to multiple new fermions involves promoting $y$ and $\mu$ to
matrices with indices for the new states, but will offer no real
phenomenological difference in the current work.\footnote{The minimal single
$N$ extension does not allow for the observed masses of the neutrinos, as the
mass matrix is rank 1. We assume that an appropriate extension has been
introduced to satisfy neutrino oscillation data while introducing no new
dynamics at the energy scales of interest.} Much work has been done
understanding the phenomenology of novel neutral states, which varies
significantly over their large parameter spaces. 
%
If these particles have masses around $10^{15}$ GeV they could provide a
natural way to suppress the size of active neutrino masses through the Type I
or III see-saw mechanisms \cite{Minkowski:1977sc, GellMann:1980vs,
Mohapatra:1979ia}. A lighter neutral fermion, with a mass around the keV scale,
remains a promising dark matter candidate \cite{Adhikari:2016bei}. A synthesis
of these ideas is found in the so-called $\nu$MSM which simultaneously can
explain dark matter, neutrino masses and successful baryogenesis
\cite{Asaka:2005pn}. 
%
If the sterile gets lighter still, with masses at the eV scale or below, an
important observable effects might exist in neutrino oscillation experiments.
Indeed, eV scale particles have been proposed to alleviate short-baseline
oscillation anomalies; although, no minimal solution seems to provide a
compelling universal improvement to the current data \cite{Kopp:2013vaa}. 
%

For steriles which are light enough to be produced in a neutrino beam,
typically with masses below the $D$-meson mass scale $m_\text{s} \lesssim
2$~GeV, there is a qualitative divide in their phenomenology somewhere between
keV and eV energies. If the sterile neutrinos are massive enough for their
mass-splittings between the light neutrinos to be larger than the wavepacket
uncertainty associated with the production mechanism, they no longer oscillate
\cite{Akhmedov:2009rb}.  
%
Once oscillation is suppressed, neutral particles produced in the beam will
propagate towards the detector and may be observed by their subsequent decay
into SM particles. Experiments seeking to measure such decays have been
performed for many years, and are generally known as beam dump experiments
where proton collisions with a target produce particles to be observed
down-wind of the source \cite{CooperSarkar:1985nh, Bergsma:1985is,
Vaitaitis:1999wq, Bernardi:1985ny, Bernardi:1987ek, Anelli:2015pba,
Alekhin:2015byh}. It has been pointed out that the difference between a beam
dump and a conventional neutrino beam is more a matter of philosophy, and we
can expect many experiments to have some sensitivity to novel heavy states
\cite{Gorbunov:2007ak, Asaka:2012bb, Adams:2013qkq}. 
%
For the BNB, we can estimate the mass at which this decoupling occurs as
follows: the decay pipe for BNB is around $50$~m in length, which is
considerably shorter than the decay lengths of the mesons in the beam.
Therefore this length defines the wavepacket width at production.  The relevant
parameter is the decoherence parameter \cite{Akhmedov:2009rb, Hernandez:2011rs}
%
\[  \xi = 2\pi \frac{\lambda_\text{d}}{\lambda_\nu}, \]
%
where $\lambda_\text{d} = 50$~m and $\lambda_\nu$ is the standard neutrino
oscillation length $\lambda_\nu = \Delta m^2/4E_\nu$. For $\xi\gg1$ the wave
packet is insufficiently broad to accommodate a coherence superposition of the
heavy and light neutrino states. We estimate that this occurs at 
%
\[  \Delta m^2 \gtrsim 20~\text{eV}^2. \] 
%
In this article we study the region of MeV scale sterile masses. These are
heavy enough to forbid oscillatory effects while light enough to be have
significant production from the meson decays associated with a conventional
neutrino beam. 

The observable signature in this model is the direct decay of the new fermion
into SM particles. In the minimal \lagrangian\ in \refeq{eq:minimallag}, the
only direct couplings to new sterile fermions are neutrino Higgs interactions.
However, these couplings generate off-diagonal neutrino bilinears below the
electroweak symmetry breaking scale, which leads to mass mixing between the
$4+$ flavours of neutrinos. This generates production and decay mechanisms of
many kinds for the state $N$ through mass insertion on an active neutrino
fermion line in a gauge mediated process. These decays have been studied
extensively in the literature \cite{Atre:2009rg} and depend only on the size of
neutrino mixing to various flavours, parameterized by the elements of an
extended $4\times4$ PMNS matrix,
%
\[ U_{e4}, \qquad U_{\mu 4} \qquad \text{and} \qquad U_{\tau 4},  \]
%
and the mass of the state $N$ itself. The branching ratios for these decays are
shown in \reffig{fig:branchingratios} as a function of mass for two extremes of
the flavour mixing pattern. On the left, we show the branching ratios if the
new state mixes with all flavours of active neutrino equally $U_{e4}=U_{\mu
4}=U_{\tau 4}$, and on the right, when the only mixing with with $\nu_e$
($U_{\mu 4}=U_{\tau 4} = 0$). The main effect of the flavour structure is to
forbid certain decays which require certain elements of the mixing matrix. This, in turn, affects the possible production
mechanisms for these particles. In a conventional neutrino beam, most neutrinos
are derived from meson decay (or secondary $\mu^\pm$ decays). If $U_{e4}=U_{\mu
4}=0$, such decays with a mass insertion for the sterile neutrino are
impossible for pions or kaons.For this reason, we will mainly focus on mixing with the first two generations. This parameter space will be probed by working
at higher energies, where the neutral fermions can be produced by decays of
charmed mesons such as $D^\pm$, by the SHiPS experiment \cite{Alekhin:2015byh, Anelli:2015pba}.  The production and decay modes studied in this paper are; 

\begin{align*}
	\pi^\pm / K^\pm \longrightarrow l^\pm \nu_N  &\longrightarrow  l^\pm \pi^\mp, \\
						& \hookrightarrow \nu_\alpha e^+ e^-, \\
						& \hookrightarrow \nu_\alpha \pi^0, \\
						& \hookrightarrow \nu_\alpha \gamma.
\end{align*}

mixing with all active flavours. Note that below 100 MeV, $\nu_N \rightarrow \nu_\alpha e^+ e^-$ is by far the most dominant visible decay.}
%
\end{figure}

\subsection{Decays of interest}


We focus on five decays in our study, which have the largest branching ratios
of all channels with visible decay products over the mass range $m_\text{s}
\lesssim 1$ GeV. This is based on the minimal sterile extension of the SM
discussed above, and the discussion in this chapter will assume this model.
However, as discussed further in \refsec{sec:BMM}, we point out that similar
decays can also occur in non-minimal models, where the relationship between
decay rate, mass and mixing can be non-standard. 
%
For sterile neutrino masses less than the pion mass, the dominant visible decay
will be into an electron-positron pair as can be seen from
\reffig{fig:branchingratios}. This is true regardless of the flavour structure
of the mixing matrix. The decay rate for this channel is given by 
%
\[ \Gamma\left(\nu_\text{s}\to \nu_i e^+e^-\right) =
\frac{G_\text{F}^2m_\text{s}^5}{96\pi^3}I_1\left(0,\frac{m_e}{m_\text{s}},\frac{ m_e}{m_\text{s}}\right).  \]
%
where 
\begin{align}
	I_1(x,y,z) & =12 \int_{(x+y)^2}^{(1-z)^2} \frac{ds}{s}(s-x^2-y^2)(1+z^2-s)\sqrt{\lambda(s,x^2,y^2)}\sqrt{\lambda(1,s,z^2)},\\
\lambda(a,b,c) &= a^2+b^2+c^2 - 2ab-2bc-2ca.
\end{align}

%
Decays of this type would generally fall into two categories of events at a LAr
detector, and accordingly we divide our analysis. The first event sample will
attempt to measure events where two tracks are resolved and two
electron-induced electromagnetic showers are observed.
%
The second sample consists of events for which the identification of two
electron-like showers is impossible. In this case, the signal would be identical
to a single photon pair-conversion. We expect a larger background for this
scenario, but as we will show, we get sizable event numbers in this channel due
to the sterile neutrino's high energy, and a tight cut on the angular
distribution can make it sensitive to sterile decays.

Also possible at these low masses, the radiative decay
$\nu_\text{s}\to\nu_i\gamma$ would generate an interesting single photon
signal \cite{PhysRevD.25.766}. In the minimal model the decay rate goes as
%
\[ \Gamma(\nu_\text{s}\to\nu_i\gamma) = \frac{G_\text{F}^2m_\text{s}^5 |U_{\alpha 4}|^2}{192 \pi^3} \left( \frac{27 \alpha}{32 \pi} \right), \]
%
this decay channel will be very small and the total decay rate can be estimated
at around $\Gamma(\nu_\text{s}\to\nu_i\gamma)/(\text{GeV}) \approx 10^{-20}
(m_\text{s}/\text{GeV})^5$, which could not be expected to be observable at
SBN.  However, in a non-minimal model this decay rate could be enhanced. For
example, such an enhancement has been proposed to resolve the MiniBooNE anomaly
\cite{Gninenko:2009ks,Gninenko:2010pr}.  

When the mass of the sterile neutrino is greater than the kinematic threshold
for the production of a neutral pion, a new decay dominates
$\nu_\text{s}\to\nu_i \pi^0$. The decay rate for this process is given by
%
\[ \Gamma\left(\nu_\text{s} \to \nu_i \pi^0\right) =
\frac{G_\text{F}^2f_\pi^2m_\text{s}^3}{64\pi} \left[1-\left(
\frac{m_\pi}{m_\text{s}} \right)^2\right].  \]

The next channel appears at the kinematic threshold for charged pion production
with a charged lepton. If mixing between the heavy mass state and the electron
neutrino is present, this decay occurs almost immediately after the $\nu\pi^0$
channel opens. However, if this mixing is negligible, there is a gap the size of
the muon mass before the $\mu^\pm\pi^\mp$ channel opens. As can be seen from
\reffig{fig:branchingratios}, these decays dominate the visible decays when
they are allowed. These decays have a similar scaling behaviour of the decay
rate to the $\nu\pi^0$ channel with an equivalent dependence on the pion
structure constant,
%
\[ \Gamma\left(\nu_\text{s} \to l^\pm\pi^\mp\right) =
	\left|U_{l4}\right|^2\frac{G_\text{F}^2f_\pi^2 |V_{ud}|^2  m_\text{s}^3}{16\pi}I\left(\frac{m_l^2}{m_\pi^2} , \frac{m_\text{s}^2}{m_\pi^2}\right) ,
\]
with 
\[
	I(x,y) = \left[ \left( 1+x+y\right) \left(1+x\right) -4 x\right] \lambda^\frac{1}{2}\left(1,x,y\right)
\]

As can be seen from Figure (\ref{fig:branchingratios}) there are several additional decays possible $\nu_s \rightarrow \nu_\alpha \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $\nu_s \rightarrow \nu_\alpha e^+ \mu^-$, however, in the kinematic region allowed under the assumption the steriles were produced in pion and kaon decays these channels have sub dominant branching ratios and are not included in this analysis.

\subsection{Non-minimal models of sterile decay}

All previous work assumed the minimal extension of one extra sterile degree of
freedom, with no additional physics such that the only decays allowed are
standard model weak processes with an active mixing scaling. 
%
In this model, all interactions of the mostly sterile mass state are produced
by neutrino mass mixing. If the fermion bilinears are removed from the
Lagrangian, the sterile decouples and all (non gravitational) observable effects
vanish. An important feature of this model is the all or nothing approach to
decay rates: there is a single parameter, the mixing between the active states
and the mostly-sterile mass state, which dictates the magnitude of all the
decay rates. This is a great asset when trying to constrain the  minimal model,
for example it allows us to place bounds on the observation of $N\to \pi^0 \nu$
despite no experiment to-date reporting the results of such a search. 
%
While this model is minimal in it assumes no new fields or dynamics beyond the
single particle added at observable scales and its renormalizable interactions,
there is no theoretically appealing mechanism to explain a neutral fermion with
a mass below the electroweak scale as well as the sizes of neutrino masses
without the presence of heavier fields in the neutrino sector. The natural
consequence of decoupling these heavy particles would be to generate
non-renormalizable operators which allow for a richer phenomenology for the
intermediate scale sterile than the terms in the minimal extension. Therefore it 
seems relevant to consider models where the minimal interactions produced by 
mass-mixing are supplemented by other operators leading to potentially 
higher decay rates.

In this scenario, the minimal couplings are always present. Therefore, without
suspicious cancellations between the mixing-derived and higher-dimensional
contributions to a decay, the non-observation of a signal in a given decay
channel tells us that the event rate is less than or equal to the bound
produced in the minimal model. The process may still be driven by new physics,
and accordingly we would interpret the factor $U^2$ differently, but the total
rate is bounded in a robust way. However, in the most general extension of the
$\nu$SM we must allow for some decays to be enhanced to a greater extent than
others. This could break the correlation between decay rates present in the
minimal model, and in the case that we are using one channel \emph{e.g.} $N\to
e^+e^-$ to bound another which has not been directly constrained \emph{e.g.}
$N\to\nu\pi^0$, the bounds on the unobserved channel are potentially violated 
and detectable signals could be present.

For the reasons discussed so far, we believe it is relevant to place bounds on
the possible decays of a neutral fermion in an extended scheme which allows for
arbitrary decay rates to visible particles (within the bounds of perturbativity
and other conventional model building constraints).
%
In this section we will consider the possibility of enlarged neutral current
decay rates for the mostly-sterile fermion. In this scenario, the production of
the novel fermion will be largely unaffected by the new physics: heavy states
will be produced in the beam from meson decay via the flavour off-diagonal
charged current interactions as usual. However, we allow for an arbitrary rate
of decay for the two channels
%
\[  \Gamma_{\gamma\nu}\text{and} \qquad
\Gamma_{\pi^0\nu}. \]
%
 When considering enlarged decay rates, we must be careful with existing bounds
on the model, as an enlarged decay rate would affect all prior beam dump
experiments in the same way until the point where baseline dependence becomes
significant.

of 1 ns is assumed to smear the observed events. }
%
\end{figure}

One of the interesting features of the SBN complex is the interplay of the
three detectors, operating similar technology but situated at different
baseline distances.
%
Light neutrinos reach the furthest detector of the SBN complex after around 2
$\mu$s; however, sterile neutrinos of MeV-scale masses can move considerably
slower as their mass gets larger. For a very boosted sterile, this difference
is small and no observable effects arise. When the sterile becomes less
boosted, however, the timing structure of the BNB becomes relevant.

In the conventional physics programme of the SBN, timing plays an important
role in the analysis of backgrounds, tight timing windows are placed around the
beam spill to limit constant rate backgrounds such as cosmogenic events. The
BNB consists of 81 Radio-Frequency buckets of approximately 2ns length,
separated by 19 ns, to form a 19.2$\mu$s spill with a frequency of 3Hz
\cite{Antonello:2015ea}.  All events inside this window, alongside all events
in the surrounding bins according to assumed resolution, are assumed to be
beam-correlated.  As can be seen in \ref{fig:timing} below, for sterile masses
around $25$ MeV, most decay events will end up in the beam timing window and
must be analysed as a signal on top of the beam-related backgrounds in the
standard analysis. However, as the sterile neutrino mass increases, the
baseline distance starts to become relevant. At $m_{\text{s}}=350$ MeV, we see
that many events still fall in the in beam timing window for SBND; however,
ICARUS sees significant deviation from this with clear peaks in
the inter-RF-bucket spacing where one would not expect to see any
beam-correlated backgrounds. Events falling outside these bins, would not be
counted as part of the beam-related event sample. Assuming the backgrounds can
be brought under control in these different timing windows, this signature
would be a striking one: a beam-related excess at SBND with none at ICARUS, but an excess at both sites in their non-beam related data. \muboone is omitted from this analysis as the achievable timing resolution is worse, $\approx 10$ns

The implication of the timing effects, is that our discussion of backgrounds
must be divided in two cases: for low mass steriles or any mass at SBND, we
must consider the beam-related backgrounds and see how these can be suppressed
to enhance the significance of the signal events. For larger masses at the two
furthest detectors, we must instead consider how to isolate our signal events
from the non-beam related background, made predominately from cosmogenic
events. In the section that follows we will discuss the details of our signal
modelling and background estimation, and compute the sensitivities to new
physics in \refsec{sec:sensitivity} including a discussion of the 
use of timing and baseline distance in \refsec{sec:baselineinterplay}. 

\section{Simulation details}

We have computed the fluxes and simulated event numbers for each beam and
detector via a custom Monte Carlo program. The program allows efficiency's to
be taken into account due to experimental details of the detector and its
capabilities in a fully correlated way between observables. 

The fluxes from BNB are taken from REF, and we assume no spectral modifications
associated with the altered kinematics of the new sterile neutrino final state.
%
Given the spectral flux of sterile neutrinos in the BNB,
$\mathrm{d}\phi/\mathrm{d}E$, we compute the total number of accepted events in
channel ``$\text{c}$'' via the following summation,
%
\[ N_\text{c} = \sum_{i} \left .
\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}E}\right|_{E_i} P_\text{D}\left(E_i\right)
W_\text{c}\left(E_i\right),  \]
%
where $P_\text{D}(E)$ is the probability for a sterile of that energy to reach
and then decay inside the detector labelled $\text{D}$. The simplest
approximation is to ignore all geometric effects, so that every particle
travels exactly along the direction of the beam line, which gives the following
probability 
%
\[ P_\text{D}\left(E\right) = e^{-\frac{\Gamma_\text{T}L}{\gamma\beta}}\left(
1-
e^{-\frac{\Gamma_\text{T}\lambda}{\gamma\beta}}\right)\frac{\Gamma_\text{c}}{\Gamma_\text{T}},
\label{eq:prob}
\]
%
where $\Gamma_\text{T}$ ($\Gamma_\text{c}$) denotes the rest-frame total decay
width (decay width into channel $\text{c}$), $m$ the mass of the sterile
neutrino, and $L$ ($\lambda$) the distance to (width of) the detector. The
combination $\gamma\beta$ is the usual special relativistic function of
velocities of the parent particle and provides the sole energy dependence of
the expression
%
\[   \frac{1}{\gamma\beta} \equiv \frac{m}{\sqrt{E^2-m^2}}. \]
%
As we are exploring a large parameter space, often this expression takes a
simplified form depending on the size of $\Gamma_\text{T}\lambda/\gamma\beta$:
%
\begin{align*} 
%
\Gamma_\text{T}\lambda \ll 1\qquad&\qquad P_\text{D} \approx
e^{-\frac{\Gamma_\text{T}L}{\gamma\beta}}\frac{\Gamma_\text{c}\lambda}{\gamma\beta}
+ \mathcal{O}\left(\Gamma_\text{T}^2\lambda^2\right),\\ 
%
\Gamma_\text{T}\lambda \gg 1\qquad&\qquad P_\text{D} \approx
e^{-\frac{\Gamma_\text{T}L}{\gamma\beta}}\frac{\Gamma_\text{c}}{\Gamma_\text{T}}
+ \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\Gamma_\text{T}\lambda}\right), 
%
\end{align*}
%
where the rate for slowly decaying particles can be seen to grow with detector
size until a width of $\lambda\sim\Gamma_\text{c}^{-1}$ where longer detectors
make no difference, as most steriles decay within a few decay lengths and
therefore we see a fixed fraction of the total events in our channel of interest. 
We will comment on how the three detectors of the SBN complex can use the 
dependence on $E$ and $L$ in these expressions to enhance their sensitivity in 
Section ??.

%
Finally, the function $W_\text{c}(E)$ is a weighting factor which accounts for
all effects which reduce the number of events in the sample: for example,
analysis cuts or detector performance effects.
%
To compute these factors, we run a Monte Carlo simulation of the decays for a
large number of sample events with a given energy. Each sterile event is
associated with a decay of type $\text{c}$. We then apply experimental analysis
cuts to the decays based on our assumptions about the detector's capabilities
and backgrounds, to produce a spectrum representing the final event sample. The
percentage of accepted events defines the weight factor for that energy. As such the full spectral shape of the signal is included.


\subsection{Sterile neutrino fluxes}

To leading order in the mass of the sterile neutrino over the pion, the fluxes
for the $\nu_\text{s}$ will be a rescaling of the fluxes for the active
neutrinos.  We take these fluxes as our input and scale them by the appropriate mixing $U_{\alpha 4}$, with an additional kinematic factor to take into account the helicity un-suppression of channels such as $\pi^+ \rightarrow e^+\nu_s$ for massive $\nu_s \gg m_e$. The flux of steriles produced from the decay of a meson M is therefore given by
\[
	\phi_{\nu_s}(E_{\nu_s}) \approx \phi_{\nu_\alpha} (E_{\nu_\alpha})\vert U_{\alpha 4}\vert^2 \frac{\rho\left( \delta_M^a , \delta_M^i \right)}{\delta_M^a \left(1- \delta_M^a\right)^2}.
\]
Where $\rho(a,b)=\mathcal{F}_M(a,b) \lambda^{\frac{1}{2}}(1,a,b)$ is a kinematic factor consisting of a term proportional to the two body phase space factor, $\lambda(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2+z^2-2(x y+yz+x z)$ and a term proportional to the matrix element, $\mathcal{F}_M(a,b)= a+b -\left(a-b\right)^2$, with $\delta_M^{a(i)}=m_{l_a(\nu_i)}^2/M^2$ \cite{PhysRevD.24.1232}. This kinematic effect for the pion and kaon, the only mesons produced in large numbers in the BNB beam, can be substantial. In the case of $\pi \rightarrow e \nu$ this factor can be up to $10^5$, which more than compensates for the significantly smaller flux of $\nu_e$  inherent in the BNB. We only consider steriles below the kinematic threshold of the kaon (388 MeV for $|U_{\mu4}|$ production and 493 MeV for $|U_{e4}|$ driven production) as although there is a small component of heavier mesons such as the D meson which could produce heavier sterile states, they are produced in very small numbers due to the relatively low energy protons of the BNB beam. As the mass of the sterile increases, we begin to see components of the flux having energies less that the sterile mass, artificially loosing these events. In order to keep the normalisation of total neutrino events constant, before $U_{\alpha 4}$ and kinematic scaling, these events are shifted to be above the sterile mass threshold. \\

The neutrino fluxes at all three SBN detectors are calculated from published MiniBooNE fluxes \cite{AguilarArevalo:2008yp}, after scaling by appropriate $1/r^2$ baseline dependence, e.g $(470/540)^2 \approx 1.3$ at $\mu$BooNE. This is similarly scaled by $1/r^2$ for ICARUS at 600m, however, an additional energy dependant flux modifier is applied for SBND at 110m to account for the softer energy spectrum due to the proximity of the detector to the production target \cite{Antonello:2015lea}. We consider sources of neutrinos that are dominant in at least one energy range including wrong sign neutrinos, smaller sub-dominant $K^+\rightarrow \pi^+\rightarrow \nu_\alpha$ as well as other contributions, predominately from meson decay chains initiated by meson-nucleus interactions, although all contributions other than neutrinos from two body meson decays are scaled by $|U_{\alpha 4}|^2$ only, not including the kinematic enhancement mentioned above. The neutrino spectrum at $\mu$BooNE is shown below in figure (\ref{fig:nuflux}).

%\subsection{Reproducing PS-191}
As a consistency check of our methodology, we reproduce in \reffig{ps191test}
the published bounds of PS-191. The detector geometry is assumed to be
$6\text{m} \times 3\text{m} \times 12 \text{m}$ and was located 128m downstream
of the Beryllium target using 19.2 GeV protons from the PS proton beam.  Fluxes
of all neutrinos produced from pion sources at PS-191 were obtained from
\cite{ps191THesis}. No accurate kaon sources could be obtained and as such only
low mass bounds are reproduced here. It must be noted that PS-191 ignored all
neutral current contributions to $\nu_N \rightarrow \nu_\alpha e^+ e^-$ and
assumed the sterile neutrinos were Dirac particles; the effective of this is
that the bounds are not directly comparable to the minimal model discussed
above, and must be scaled appropiately.

%\section{BNB Beam Timing}
%The above beam related backgrounds are relavent for lower mass steriles, $m_s \leq 50$ MeV and for highly boosted heavy steriles at SBND. Once the sterile becomes less boosted, however, the timing structure of the BNB becomes very relevant for which backgrounds dominate. The Booster neutrino beam consists of 81 Radio-Frequency(RF) buckets of approximately 2ns length, seperated by 19 ns, to form a 19.2$\mu$s spill with a frequency of 3Hz. All events inside this window, alongside all events in the surrounding bins according to an assumed 1ns resolution, are possibly beam-correlated. As can be seen in \ref{fig:timing} below, this is mainly true for light sterile neutrinos at all three SBN detectors, as well as a resonable approximation of heavy neutrino timings at SBND, however, $\mu$BooNE and ICARUS see significant deviation from this with clear peaks in the inter-RF-bucket spacing where one would not expect to see any beam-correlated backgrounds. \\
%
%Outside of the RF bucket timing window, where beam-driven backgrounds are relavant, one must have a very strong grasp of cosmogenics backgrounds. However, due to the high energy and very forwardness of the decay events, alongside the fact that one can observe the cosmogenic background in beam-off mode, gives us {\bf {\emph{faith}}} that one can get veyr close to backgroundless (Ya need to show this..). 
%
%The use of timing signals is significantly enhanced by the fact SBN has three detectors at varying baselines. If one observes an excess of events in SBND that appears consistant with a heavy sterile decaying in flight, this must correlate with a scaled number of events with an appropiate out-of bucket phase in both $\mu$BooNE and ICARUS. If this is not observed, one can rule out the decay in flight scenario.

The 2 ns beam bucket window is shown highlighted in red from 0 to 2 ns, followed by an additional 19 ns gap. The timings are calculated as a difference relative to the time of flight of a active neutrino, assuming the decay occured in a uniform sample accross the 50m BNB decay pipe. A timing resolution of 1ns for all three SBN detectors is assumed to smear the observed events.}

\section{Sensitivities\label{sec:sensitivity}}
In this section we present the results of a sensitivity analysis for the three dectors at the SBN facility. Although the largest sensitivity comes from SBN, \muboone is already collecting data and thus will be able to report on possible signals significantly earlier that SBN and ICARUS. \reffig{fig:band_sbn} shows the sensitivity achievable at the the SBN detector in the four channels studied. The dashed lines show the results of a backgroundless search, corresponding to the theoretical best achievable sensitivity at the facility, assuming perfect signal efficiency. The results of a simple cut based background analysis is also included as the solid colored line. This analysis is not optimsed, however, and serves primarily to show the potential impact of backgrounds. We estimate the true achievable sensitivity in each channel would lie somewhere between these two curves (the solid shaded region). The analysis only considers the total number of events in each channel, with the 90\% C.L defined as $2.44$ events, following the procedure of \refref{Feldman:1997qc} designed for backgroundless searches for rare events.  \\


As can be seen SBN potentially sees significantly more events, and thus improves the bounds in all channels and on all mixing elements. \muboone and ICARUS are slightly better than the corresponding PS191 bounds for low mass steriles (due to the lower energy neutrino spectrum) and approximately equal at higher masses. The previously unbounded $\nu_N \rightarrow \nu_\alpha \pi^0$ could be bounded at a level similar to PS191 $e^+ e^-$ channel.

In all panels, the mixing matrix elements not shown on the $y$-axis are zero. Above we have the previously bounded channels, $e^+e^-$ and $l^- \pi^+$ for nonzero $U_{\mu 4}$ and $U_{e4}$ respectively. Below we have the same for the unbounded $\gamma$ and $\pi^0$ channels.}

%In order to facilitate the search for new physics we provide results in terms
%of a total scaling $\Gamma$, of each decay channel of interest. We retain the
%functional dependance on sterile mass as in the minimal, bounding $\Gamma \vert
%U_{\alpha 4}\vert^2$. \\

%standard model weak processes with an active mixing scaling. Beyond this there
%are many extensions worth considering, if the sterile sector is charged under a
%new gauge symmetry, e.g $U(1)'$, then the total decay rate can be significantly
%modified. Additional new particle content that couples strongly with the sterile
%states can also drastically change the expected rate with respect to the minimal
%extension, as well as open up entirely new decay channels, such as the possible
%radioactive decay $\nu_N \rightarrow \nu_\alpha \gamma$, which can also be probed
%at the SBN and provides a window to searches for large sterile magnetic
%moments. In order to facilitate the search for new physics we provide results
%in terms of a total scaling $\Gamma$, of each decay channel of interest. We
%retain the functional dependence on sterile mass as in the minimal, bounding
%$\Gamma \vert U_{\alpha 4}\vert^2$. \\

%If there was an enhancement of $\alpha$ in a single channel, $\Gamma_c$, such
%that the total decay width becomes $\Gamma_\text{tot} =
%\Gamma_\text{oth}+\Gamma_c (1+\vert U_{\mu 4}\vert^2 \alpha)$, then previous
%experiments searching for heavy sterile decays would have had much more
%stringent bounds on $\vert U_{\mu 4} \vert^2$. We can estimate these enhanced
%bounds by comparing the probability to decay in a particular channel, with the
%probability associated with the published bounds, in particular we need to find
%the new value for the 90\% C.L bound, $\vert U_{\mu 4}\vert^2$, such that the
%probability to decay inside a detector of baseline L and length $\lambda$, with
%a total rate  $\Gamma_\text{tot} = \vert U_{\mu 4}\vert^2
%\left(\Gamma_\text{oth}^\prime+\Gamma_c^\prime (1+\alpha)\right)$, is equal to
%the probability to decay inside the same detector with total rate
%$\tilde{\Gamma}_\text{tot} = \vert U_{\mu 4}^*\vert^2(m_S)
%\left(\Gamma_\text{oth}^\prime+\Gamma_c^\prime\right)$, where $\vert U_{\mu
%4}^*\vert^2(m_S) $ indicates the published bound on that channel, for a sterile
%of mass $m_S$, and primed decay widths indicate the width with mixing removed
%to the front. Using the functional form of the probability in equation
%\ref{eq:prob}, and expanding to leading order in the assumed small parameter
%$\lambda/L$, there are two solutions to this corresponding to the two real
%branches of the Lambert-W function. The two solutions correspond physically to
%the cases where an increasing decay rate increases the number of observed
%events in a detector thus increasing the bound, $\mathcal{W}_0$, up until the
%decay rate becomes sufficiently large to ensure the majority of the events
%decay before reaching the detector, $\mathcal{W}_{-1}$. This places the 90\%
%C.L exclusion in a region \[	-\frac{\vert U_{\mu 4}^* \vert^2}{ \kappa
%\Gamma_\text{tot}^{*}} \mathcal{W}_{-1} \left[-\frac{\kappa
%\Gamma_\text{tot}^{*}}{1+\alpha} \exp\left(
%-\kappa(\Gamma_c^*+\Gamma_\text{oth}^*) \right)     \right]	\geq \vert
%U_{\mu 4} \vert^2 \geq \frac{\vert U_{\mu 4}^* \vert^2}{1+\alpha} \] where
%$\kappa = \frac{L}{\gamma \beta}$ and we have expanded $\mathcal{W}_0$ to
%leading order in $\vert U_{\mu 4}^*\vert^2$ for clarity to see it scales as
%expected with enhancement $(1+\alpha)$ , no such convenient expansion exists
%for  $\mathcal{W}_{-1}$.

%channels. In \reffig{fig:no_cuts_scaled_bkg}, we consider the quantity
%$S/\sqrt{\lambda B}$ and plot contours when the parameter is equal to $1$. At
%this point, the size of the new signal events from the heavy sterile decays are
%equal to the Poisson noise in the experiment under the approximation of no
%signal. The parameter $\lambda$ is used to scale the backgrounds, corresponding
%to a greater ability to suppresses these events.  We show two regions, the most
%conservative line corresponds to $\lambda=1$ with no additional background
%suppression beyond our estimates, whilst the more optimistic one corresponds to
%a further suppression by a factor of 1000. Our estimates are given by the
%largest numbers in \reftab{tab:rates} for each channel, that is assuming no
%analysis-based reduction in rates. As before, we do not take into account the
%signal efficiency in these plots (weight factors are set to $1$) this makes the

\section{Potential Backgrounds\label{sec:bg}}
In order to estimate the effect of expected backgrounds on the sensitivity we have performed a Monte-Carlo analysis using the neutrino event generator GENIE (cite GENIE). This provides us with generator level information about the kinematics of the beam-driven backgrounds, with rates normalised off expected NC and CC inclusive values as published in the SBN proposal. Energy and angular smearing is then implemented to allow for approximate estimates of the effects of detector performance to the level necessary for this analysis, without the need for a full GEANT detector simulation. Energies are smeared according to a Gaussian distribution around their true MC energies, with a relative variance $\sigma_E/E = \xi/ \sqrt(E) $, where $\xi$ is a detector dependant resolution. For this study we take the energy resolution for EM showers, muons and protons to be 15\%, 6\% and a conservative 15\% respectively. We take the angular resolution of LAr to be $1^{\circ}$. 

Of utmost importance in all studied channels to distinguishing signal and background is the identification of a scattering vertex. Any hadronic activity localized at the beginning of the lepton track is a smoking gun signal for beam related scattering from deep-inelastic or quasi-elastic scattering. Therefore any event containing one or more reconstructed protons or additional hadrons is rejected outright. For counting this proton multiplicity we assume an detection threshold of 21 MeV on proton kinetic energy in liquid Argon, after smearing. Background events that contain less than this and events that do not contain any protons, such as events originating from coherent pion production, remain a viable background and further rejection must come from the kinematics of the final state particles only. 

All two body visible decays discussed below have a powerful discriminator in the reconstructed invariant mass of the charged particle pair, e.g  $M_{l^\pm \pi^\mp}^2=m_l^2+m_{p^\pm}^2+ 2(E_l E_\pi - |P_l||P_\pi|\cos\theta_\text{sep})$ for $\nu_N \rightarrow \pi^+ l^-$, which sum to that of the the parent sterile (within detector resolution), where as the background is expected form a broad spectra spanning the energies of incoming neutrino. Additionaly, two body decays allow for reconstruction of the parent sterile angle with respect to the beamline which is assumed to be close to on-axis, unlike the more isotropic backgrounds. We found $\approx 95$\% of reconstructed sterile from two bodys decays were below $4^\circ$ relative to the beamline and we cut all events greater than this.

\end{figure}
\subsection{$\nu_N \rightarrow \mu^\pm \pi^\mp$ and $\nu_N \rightarrow e^\pm \pi^\mp$   }
The dominant backgrounds to the sterile decays we are interested in will be genuine $\pi$-lepton production associated with
the neutrino beam. So-called CC1$\pi^+$ events are defined as the associated production of a charged pion from the standard CC process which produces a lepton. These events can be produced incoherently, often with large hadronic activity, or from coherent scattering, where the neutrino scatters from the whole nucleus. These coherent interactions tend to produce more forward decay products and will be another significant source of backgrounds. Coherent cross-sections for these processes have been studied in MiniBooNE \cite{Wascko:2006tx}, \minerva \cite{Eberly:2014mra} and lately T2K and cross-sections appear to agree with Monte Carlo calculations based on the Rein-Sehgal model \cite{Rein:2006di, Rein:1982pf}.
Such a low $Q^2$ process tends to favour daughter pions and muons that are forward going, kinematically very similar to decays in flight, as well as no observable nuclear activity and as such are a potent background.\\ 

The expected numbers of $e \pi$ events in the SBN detectors is significantly smaller than that of the $\mu \pi$ channel, as the fraction of intrinsic $\nu_e$ in the BNB beam is of
$\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ level in comparison to $\nu_\mu$. However, there will also be additional backgrounds to the
$e \pi$ channel originating from the dominant $\nu_\mu$ beam. CC $\nu_\mu$ events which contain an additional photon $(\mu+\gamma)$, or 1 reconstructed photon from a $\pi^0$ decay, have the potential to be be mis-identified as an $(\pi
e)$ event, provided the muon has a sufficiently short track length, $<$ 0.5 m, in order to mimic a $\pi^-$. Additionally the photon must be mis-identified as an electron, with an efficiency of 94\%, and furthermore, must convert to an $e^+e^-$ pair close enough to the interaction vertex as so there is no visible gap. Thus we accept 6\% of all CC $\mu+\gamma$ events whose photon converts within 3cm, and whose muon track length is less than 0.5m. Combined with the rejection of events with any vertex activity, this reduces the number of background events to below that expected from intrinsic CC $\nu_e$ pion production. As energy resolution for EM showers is lower than muons, the invariant mass cut is less powerful requiring all events have an invariant mass below 500 MeV. 

Additional kinematic cuts are selected to further decrease backgrounds. A cut on lepton-pion opening angle, $\theta_{l \pi} < 40^\circ$ as well as indicidual emission angles, $\theta_{l,\pi} < 80^\circ$, reduces the potential background from 1,153,090 in SBND to approximately 323 events for $\mu^- \pi^+$.  Figure (\ref{fig:mu_pi_cutflow}) shows the background rejection capability of LAr as each additional cut is implemented in $\mu$BooNE, in comparason to a 350 MeV sterile decay. The $e^- \pi^+$ channel is one of the cleanest channel under consideration, with 9223 events in SBND reducing to 22 expected events post cuts, and with $\mu$BooNE and ICARUS expecting $\mathcal{O}(1)$ events from beam driven backgrounds.


\subsection{$\nu_N \rightarrow \nu_\alpha e^+ e^-$ and $\nu_N \rightarrow \gamma \nu_\alpha$ }
A sufficiently boosted, and thus overlapping, $e^+e^-$ pair is topologically indistinguishable from a converted photon in a LAr detector. Additional, non-topological measures such as the rate of energy loss, $dE/dx$, is also identical to a pair-converted photon. Thus we split this channel into two sub categories, when the $e^+e^-$ is overlapping and photon-like, defined to be all events whose angular separation is $\leq 3^\circ$\cite{Spitz:2011wba} and all remaining separable two track events. The opening angle between the $e^+e^-$ in a photon pair production scales roughly as $\approx m_e/E_\gamma$, with $3^\circ$ corresponding to 100 MeV and used as a lower bound on energy. These backgrounds are also applicable to the $\nu_N \rightarrow \nu_\gamma \nu_\alpha$ channel.\\ 

Any standard process producing a lone stray photon is thus a possible source of backgrounds for the photon-like $e^+e^-$ channel. The predominant source of this in all three SBN detectors is the decay of a neutral pion in which a single photon is not resolved or escapes the fiducial volume. This background, however, is relatively isotropic in distribution and of lower energy that the signal, in stark contrast to the very forward signal. Thus we apply a cut on visible photon energy, $E_\gamma \geq 300 $ MeV and angle of the observed photon to the beamline, $\theta_\gamma \leq 5^\circ$. In conjunction with the requirement that no vertex activity is recorded, this reduced the number of expected events from 42,580 to 176 events in SBND, while retaining a signal efficiency of 93\%.

For the opposite scenario both daughter electrons have a well defined, and large, separation and thus can cleanly be identified as two distinct single electron showers. There are no significant processes that produce high energy, distinguishable $e^+e^-$ pairs in a standrd neutrino beam.  Instead the majority of the backgrounds are due to misidentifying photons, which are abundant, as electrons. This can either be a single photon alongside a CC $e^-$ event or the more common NC $\pi^0$ production in which both of the underlying photons are mis-identified as electrons. As both of these backgrounds require the photons to mimic electrons originating from a single decay vertex, we also require that all photons pair convert within 3cm of the start of the electron track in the case of CC $\nu_e$ backgrounds, or both photons convert within 3cm of each other in the case of NC $\pi^0$ backgrounds. Further more, each event passing the above cuts is rejected with a 94\% efficiency using measurements of the rate of energy loss, $dE\/dx$. All remaining events are kept as backgrounds. To further reject backgrounds we apply a cut on angle of separation between the distinct $e^-e^-$ tracks of $\theta_\text{sep}\leq 40 ^\circ$ and total energy, $E_{e^+}+E_{e^-} \geq 100$ MeV. This reduces the number of expected backgrounds from 173 events to 5 events in SBND.

Total expected background of 10,813 events is reduced to $\approx$ 51 by utilising forwardness of pion produced in decays, alongside the requirement of no hadronic activity. }
%\end{figure}

\subsection{$\nu_N \rightarrow \pi^0 \nu_\alpha$}
Although a sub-dominant decay mode when steriles mix with electrons alone, when one considers non-zero $\vert U_{\mu4}\vert^2$ the branching ratio of $\nu_s \rightarrow \nu_\mu \pi^0$ becomes dominant for a mass window $\approx 140 \rightarrow 240$ MeV. There is no known experimental publication of $\nu_N \rightarrow \nu_\alpha \pi^0$ in the literature, mainly due to the large expected backgrounds. Single neutral pions are produced in great numbers at the three SBN facilities, so the lack of any nuclear recoil is crucial in eliminating the incoherent neutral pion production background. As the $\pi^0$ itself is not visible, we focus on the reconstructed pion energy and angle, inferred from measuring the resultant photons energy and angle, smeared as usual to model detector effects. Only events in which both photons convert inside the fiducial volume are accepted. SBND expects 127,211 $\pi^0$ events, of which $\approx 602$ survive all cuts with a signal efficiency of 32\% for a sample 350 MeV sterile. \\ 

To summerise, we collect the total numbers of beam-induced background events expected at the three SBN below in Table (\ref{tab:Rates}), both before and after we apply all visible vertex and kinematic cuts as described above. One can see that LAr provides an impressive level of background rejection, with \muboone and ICARUS being close to backgroundless in many channels, and SBND expecting only $\mathcal{O}(100)$ events in all channels.

\subsection{Non-Beam related backgrounds}
Cosmogenic backgrounds are expected to be significantly smaller in comparison to beam related backgrounds. In the case of cosmic muons, \icarus\ expects to see approximately $2.5 \times 10^{6}$ cosmic events in the 211 second beam spill,
and are reduced to approximately 5 events expected after utilizing the spill
structure, scintillation light patterns and cuts on $\frac{d E}{d x}$
\cite{Antonello:2015lea}.  Alongside this impressive cosmic rejection, our signal
events are focused heavily along the beamline, hence we do not expect cosmics
to be a major source of background to any channel are are not included in this
analysis. 


\section{\label{sec:baselineinterplay}Model comparison at the SBN complex}

%1. intro
Given the existing anomalies in short baseline neutrino experiments, including
MiniBooNE which operated in the Booster beamline, the possibility of seeing an
anomalous signature at the SBN complex should not be ignored. There are
competing theoretical explanations for existing excesses: oscillatory sterile
neutrinos \cite{Everyone...}, neutrino decay \cite{Pascoli, Schwetz}, neutrino
production and decay inside the detector \cite{Gninenko, Meloni, Us?}. Taking 
this as motivation, we consider here the differentiating characteristics of some 
different models of new physics in the neutrino sector. 

%2. features of SBN which are interesting
The combination of the three SBN detectors, all operating with the same
technology in the same neutrino beam, allows for distinctive signatures of new
physics. In this section, we assess the potential for SBN to investigate an
excess of events seen at one or all of the detectors. 
%
Secondly, we discuss the role of event timing information can
have on model selection.  Timing delays between excesses would be strong
evidence for heavy particles propagating between source and detector, and we
explore how the study of timing effects could be used to bound the mass of the
particle in a model independent fashion.

We consider three possible explanations for an anomalous excess of particles:

%3. models to be distinguished between
\subsection{Comparison between sterile neutrino oscillations and decays in flight}

The oscillatory sterile explanation of low-energy anomalies in neutrino data is
theoretically appealing if not entirely phenomenologically satisfactory. Either
way, the SBN complex will be able to place important constraints on these
models. With the purposes of our present study in mind, there is little chance
that an oscillatory sterile could be confused by a MeV scale decaying sterile.
The signal for an oscillatory sterile would be a single electron, arising from
a charged-current quasi-elastic processes. There are no channels available to a
decaying sterile neutrino which could produce such a signal without an
additional (charged) particle. 

\newtext{PB}{Would it be worth writing anything here about electron(s)/photon
discrimination?}

There is also a strong difference in the baseline dependence which may be
visible at SBN. \newtext{PB}{It feels a bit pointless to fill this section
out.}

\subsection{Differences between decays in flight and production/decay in situ}

The model of Gninenko \cite{Gninenko:2009ks,Gninenko:2010pr} which seeks to
explain the MiniBooNE excess through the production and decay of a new sterile
fermion inside the detector, has received significant attention in the
literature. This model general requires quite a large non-minimal transition
magnetic moment to ensure sufficient decays. 

Our model of decaying sterile neutrinos in flight is formally similar to the
Gninenko model, albeit with a more general set of observable final states. The
main difference lies in the region of parameter space for which a signal would
be generated for any beam dump experiment. With the high decay rates of
Gninenko, no significant sterile component would exist in the beam by the time
the particles reached SBND. Vice versa, the minimal sterile model simply does
not have a high enough decay rate to see any decays after particle productions
inside the detector via mixing-matrix element mediated neutral current
scattering. However, without a knowledge of the true parameter space, these two
models could be confused. The main way to distinguish them would be through
their spectrum of events. Although both models produce visible particles
through sterile neutrino decay in flight, the additional neutral current
cross-section required by the Gninenko-type sterile suppresses the lowest
energy events. As can be seen in \reffig{fig:XXX}, we see a marked difference
between these signals at SBND. If we factor in the cut-based analysis that was
performed in the preceeding section, we see that the model in this paper does
lose a significant number of events from the lowest bins. To separate these
events cleanly, the analysis should be optimised to keep as many of these
lowest energy events as possible. 

\newtext{PB}{A relevant point here would be the use of timing.}

%
%\subsection{Scaling behaviour of event rates}
%
%Any source of excess events which is induced by the neutrino beam should
%inherit a $L^{-2}$ dependence on baseline distance from the dispersion of the
%neutrino flux. Between three detectors, this would generate a distinctive
%relative enhancement of the signal at SBND and relative suppression of the
%signal at \icarus\ compared to a fixed nominal excess at \muboone. This is in
%contrast to, for example, an excess of misidentified cosmogenic events which
%would have no baseline dependence.
%
%New physics may cause a signficant dependence on baseline. One of the much
%discussed ways to explain an excess of events at a short baseline neutrino
%experiment is through sterile neutrino oscillations. The rates predicted at
%three different detectors depend crucially on the respective distances from
%source to detector according to the oscillation prbobability. In the scenarios
%discussed in this paper, we also see baseline dependence coming from
%\refeq{eq:prob}, albeit in a very different form. For most of the parameter
%space, we predict no significant baseline dependence on the event rates
%at the three detectors, once the $1/L^2$ dependence of the flux is removed;
%however, for large decay rates we see a baseline dependent effect. This is
%shown in \reffig{fig:baselineratios}, where the event numbers for $e^-e^-$
%decay are shown as ratios between the three detectors. These have been scaled
%to remove the baseline dependence of the flux.  The four lines for each
%detector show the 100\%, 75\%, 50\% and 25\% contours (where the further
%detector sees fewer events). Such decay rates are forbidden in the minimal
%extension of the SM incorporating MeV scale sterile neutrinos
%\newtext{PB}{True?}. In a non-minimal model, it remains possible that decays
%with decay lengths of the order $100$~m could exist, leading to a very 
%significant depletion of events at the further detectors.
%
%We show in \reffig{fig:baselineratios} a plot highlighting the contrasting
%behaviour between these alternative explanations for an excess seen at the SBN
%complex. In these plots we assume a fixed $100$ events at \muboone\ and observe
%the distribution of events at the other sites for different models of new
%physics.

\subsection{\label{sec:timing_physics}Timing for model discrimination}

A unique feature of the SBN complex is its combination of three detectors
situated at distinct baselines. One opportunity that this suggests is the
observation of time delayed signals between the sites. As particles with finite
rest mass, the heavy neutral leptons will propagate at subluminal speeds and
for larger masses can produce observable timing delays. If an excess of events
is observed with a clear timing delay between SBND and \icarus, this would be
very difficult to explain using an oscillatory sterile, neutrino induced
beam-correlated signal or other non-beam background and would be a clear
indication of a heavy propagating degree of freedom. 

We can estimate the impact of this information on the model discrimination
given an knowledge of the precision in timing measurements of the sterile
neutrinos. Elementary special relativity tells us that for an arrival time delay (behind a luminal particle) over a distance $L$ denoted by $\Delta T$, the mass of a sterile neutrino with an energy $E$ can be reconstructed as 
%
%\[    \Delta T = \frac{L}{c}\left(\frac{E}{\sqrt{E^2-m_\text{s}^2}} - 1\right). \]
%
\[ m_\text{s} = E\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{\left(1+\frac{c\Delta T}{L}\right)^2}}. \]

To determine the prospects for measuring $m_\text{s}$ using this information we
have generated Monte Carlo event data tagging each event by an arrival time.
We account for a systematic uncertainty associated with the time measurement as
well as the energy reconstruction. We smear energy to represent detector effects as described above, and aditional smear the time of each event with a finite time
resolution of $\sigma_T  \approx 2$ for SBND and ICARUS. \\

\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/timing_scatterplots.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:tof_scatter} The distribution of events at ICARUS for a 150, 250 and 350 MeV sterile decaying to $e \pi$ in energy and timing delay from last beam bucket. High energy events can be used to distinguish the decaying sterile masses.}
\end{figure}


%If one knew the exact bucket that the heavy sterile orgininated from, one could use this immediately to obtain an estimate of the sterile mass. However, apart from in the initial buckets in a given spill, the bucket from which a single event originated cannot be known to any certainty. As such each sterile event for a given energy corresponds to up to 80 possible reconstructed masses depending on the absolute position of the event in respect to the spill time. In this analysis we ignore all edge effects due to the fact each spill consists of a finite number of buckets and assume no knoweldge of the events parent bucket. To discriminate between sterile mass models we then perform a scan of hypothesised masses assigning a parent bucket to each event such that it minimises the difference between reconstructed mass and hypothesised mass. A spectrum of reconstructed masses is then produced for each hypothesis and the task is reduced to a peak finding problem. 

%As a test we construct a Jarque–Bera test statistic for the finding of a single, gaussian-like peak. The likelihood of a given spectrum of events corresponding to a peak surrounding  $m_\text{hypothesis}$ is shown below in Figure (\ref{fig:tof}) for a $m_\text{true} = 0.350$ GeV.

If $m_\text{hypothesis} \leq m_\text{true}$ one can always push the parent bucket further back in time to achieve a good fit, therefore discrimination power of the further detectors begins to fail. This begins to happen at large masses, $m_\text{hypothesis} \approx 0.6$ GeV, larger than those of interest in this study. Due to the bad timing resolution of $\mu$BooNE in comparason to ICARUS and SBND, it contributes little to this anaysis.}

\section{Conclusions}

The Fermilab Short-Baseline Neutrino complex will further our knowledge of
neutrino beams at short-baseline and neutrino interactions. In this paper, we
have studied its capabilities to constrain decaying sterile neutrinos with
masses around the MeV scale. To make a fair assessment of the potential to
constrain these models, we have performed a simple cut-based analysis of the dominant
backgrounds and signals and shown that high levels of background suppression
can be expected, resulting in close to backgroundless searches. We have
identified the importance of timing on both the appearance of new signals and
the analysis of backgrounds to these signals. Using these background estimates,
we have performed a sensitivity analysis to the parameters of the minimal
extension of the SM with a novel sterile neutrino. We have also motivated
searches for non-minimal models, which in particular could lead to observable
decays over a wide range of parameter space which is conventionally excluded by
theoretical assumptions on the decay rates themselves. We argue that these
decay rates are actually \emph{unconstrained} in published work, and show that
the SBN could place the first bounds on these processes.
